# Form E Analysis - Lenny Kaye
## Dated 28 November 2025

---

## Executive Summary

The Form E contains several **internal inconsistencies** and **disclosure gaps** that strengthen the case for the questionnaire. Most significantly:

1. She denies living with a new partner but lists Terry Thorne as a co-occupant and completes section 4.6 (new partner's finances)
2. Her income needs schedule contains **no housing costs whatsoever** - no rent, utilities, council tax, or food
3. The M&G payment and loan to Joylyn Gray remain undisclosed
4. Child Benefit is omitted
5. One pension is marked as "in drawdown" at age 35 - highly unusual

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. THE COHABITATION CONTRADICTION

**Section 1.8:** "Are you living with a new partner?" - **No**
**Section 1.9:** "Do you intend to live with a new partner within the next six months?" - **No**

**BUT Section 1.16 (Present Residence) states:**
- Address: 12A Newhaven Court, Court Drive, Cromer, NR27 9DL
- Occupants: **Terry Thorne**
- Terms: Tenant

**AND Section 4.6 is completed** - This section is specifically headed: *"If you have subsequently married or formed a civil partnership (or intend to) **or are living with another person** (or intend to), give brief details..."*

She has disclosed Terry Thorne's income as:
- Salary: £27,000 gross
- Total assets/liabilities: £0

**Analysis:** This is internally inconsistent. By completing section 4.6, she acknowledges living with another person. But she denies at 1.8 that this is a "new partner." She cannot have it both ways:
- If Terry Thorne is just a housemate/lodger, section 4.6 should not have been completed
- If he is someone she is "living with" within the meaning of 4.6, then 1.8 is potentially false

**Relevance:** Goes directly to credibility and to whether she has access to resources/support beyond her own income.

---

### 2. THE MISSING HOUSING COSTS

**Section 3.1.1 (Income needs for yourself) lists:**
- Mobile: £36.41
- Holidays: £300
- Petrol: £200
- Car insurance: £54
- **Sub-total: £650/month**

**What is NOT listed:**
- Rent
- Council tax
- Gas
- Electricity
- Water
- Food/groceries
- Internet/broadband
- TV licence
- Home insurance

**Analysis:** This is implausible. These are basic living costs that everyone incurs. The only logical explanation is that **she is not paying them** - i.e., Terry Thorne (or someone else) is meeting these costs on her behalf.

If she claims rent of, say, £800-1,000/month for a 2-bed property in Cromer, plus utilities of £200-300, plus food of £300-400, her needs would be dramatically higher. Their absence speaks volumes.

**Relevance:** This is the smoking gun for the questionnaire's central thesis: that her housing is being subsidised and her true needs are lower than she claims, or her true resources are higher.

---

### 3. UNDISCLOSED ASSETS

#### M&G Trustee Company Payment (£1,912.47 on 4 June 2025)

**Form E Section 2.4 (Investments):** £0
**Form E Section 2.5 (Life insurance/endowment):** £0
**Form E Section 2.14 (Other assets):** £0

The M&G payment is not explained anywhere. Possible sources:
- Investment policy encashment
- Workplace pension from previous employer
- Trust distribution
- Policy maturity

**Relevance:** If this came from an ongoing investment or policy, there may be a residual fund not disclosed.

#### Loan to Joylyn Gray (£1,000)

**Form E Section 2.6 (Debts owed to you):** £0

Bank statements show she paid £1,000 to Joylyn Gray on 6 June 2025 referenced "Citizenship." On 5 September 2025 she received £200 back referenced "Loan."

If this was a loan, approximately £800 remains outstanding. This is an asset (debt owed to her) that should have been disclosed at section 2.6.

---

### 4. CHILD BENEFIT OMISSION

**Form E Section 2.18 (State benefits) lists:**
- Child Maintenance: £30.42/month
- Universal Credit: £419.66/month

**Not listed:** Child Benefit

Bank statements show regular receipts of approximately £26.05 which appear to be Child Benefit for one child.

**Note:** Child Maintenance is also incorrectly categorised. It is not a state benefit - it is maintenance from the other parent. It should properly appear in Section 2.19 (Other income). This is a minor error but reflects sloppy completion.

---

### 5. THE PENSIONBEE "IN DRAWDOWN" ISSUE

The supplementary page discloses a PensionBee pension:
- Value: £6,580.14
- **"Is the pension in payment or drawdown?"** - **Yes** (ticked)

**Analysis:** She is 35 years old. The minimum pension age is 55 (rising to 57). You cannot normally access a pension before this age unless:
- Severe ill-health (she declares "good health" at 1.11)
- Protected pension age from certain legacy schemes

If she has genuinely drawn from this pension, this is highly unusual. It may explain the M&G payment if that was a pension lump sum withdrawal.

**Relevance:** If pension funds have been accessed early, the court needs to understand how and why. If this is an error on the form, it undermines the reliability of her disclosure generally.

---

### 6. FAMILY HOME STATUS

The family home at 3 St Peter's Close, Knapton is disclosed as:
- **Owned by: Respondent's mother**
- Value: £540,000
- Her interest: £0

**Analysis:** This is correctly disclosed as having no value to her. However, it means there is no matrimonial property to divide. Her claim for "access to remaining matrimonial assets" at section 5.1(d) must therefore relate to chattels, pensions, or other assets rather than property.

## Summary Table: Form E vs Bank Statement Evidence

| Issue | Form E Says | Bank Statements Show | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Living with partner | No (1.8) | N/A | **Contradicted by 1.16 and 4.6** |
| Housing costs | £0 | No rent payments post-move | **Unexplained** |
| M&G payment | Not disclosed | £1,912.47 received 4 June | **Undisclosed** |
| Loan to J Gray | £0 owed to her | £1,000 paid out, £200 returned | **~£800 undisclosed asset** |
| Child Benefit | Not disclosed | ~£26/month received | **Omitted** |
| Pension in drawdown | Yes (PensionBee) | Unknown | **Needs explanation** |

## Recommended Additional Questions

Based on this analysis, consider adding:

**Re: Section 4.6**
> You have completed Section 4.6 of Form E, disclosing the income of a person with whom you are living. Please clarify why you answered "No" to Question 1.8, which asks whether you are living with a new partner.

**Re: Housing Costs**
> Your income needs schedule at Section 3.1.1 contains no provision for rent, council tax, utilities, or food. Please confirm:
> (a) Whether these costs are being met by you;
> (b) If so, provide the monthly amounts;
> (c) If not, identify who is meeting these costs on your behalf.

**Re: PensionBee Drawdown**
> Section 2.13 of Form E indicates your PensionBee pension is "in payment or drawdown." Given you are aged 35, please explain:
> (a) On what basis you have accessed this pension before minimum pension age;
> (b) What sum (if any) has been withdrawn;
> (c) Whether the M&G payment of £1,912.47 on 4 June 2025 relates to this pension.

## Strategic Observations

1. **The housing costs omission is your strongest point.** It's not accusatory - it's a simple factual gap. Everyone has housing costs. Either she's not paying them (which supports your case) or she's failed to disclose them (which is incomplete disclosure).

2. **The 1.8/4.6 contradiction is worth raising** but frame it neutrally: "Please clarify the apparent inconsistency between..." rather than "You lied about..."

3. **The pension drawdown point is intriguing** but may have an innocent explanation (form completion error). Worth asking about but don't over-invest in it.

4. **Keep the focus on the financial position**, not the relationship with Mr Thorne. Whether they're romantically involved is less important than whether he's subsidising her housing. The documents will reveal the latter without needing her to admit the former.
