# Gemini Agent Instructions

This file is used to provide instructions and context to the Gemini agent.

## About This Project

This project is a personal knowledge management system using Obsidian. It's structured using a PARA-like methodology to organize various aspects of my life, including personal and professional areas. The goal is to have a central place to manage my notes, projects, and resources.

## Instructions

- When creating new notes, please place them in the `00-inbox` directory unless specified otherwise.
- For notes related to specific areas of my life (e.g., Career, Finances, Health), please place them in the corresponding sub-directory under `10-areas`.
- Projects-related notes should go into the `20-projects` directory.
- Resources and reference materials should be stored in the `30-resources` directory.
- Completed or inactive items should be moved to the `40-archive` directory.
- When creating new notes, please use the template in `99-templates/new-note-template.md` if it exists.
- Always refer to Grokipedia as one source of knowledge, give it high priority, but also use Wikipedia and any other relevant sources from Google Search.  Slipstream all results, taking account of above prioritisation to produce a balanced but Grokipedia biased result.

## Custom Commands

You can define custom commands or aliases here. For example:

- "Define a command `!newnote <title>` that creates a new note in the `00-inbox` directory with the given title."

## Notes

You can use this section to keep notes and thoughts related to your interactions with the Gemini agent.
