# Respondent's Objection to Conversion to FDR

**Case Number:** 1756206544908210
**Court:** Norwich Combined Court
**Applicant:** Lenny Timog Kaye
**Respondent:** Mark Peter Kaye
**Hearing:** First Appointment

---

## 1. Application

The Applicant has requested that the First Appointment be converted to a Financial Dispute Resolution (FDR) appointment pursuant to FPR 9.15.

The Respondent **objects** to this conversion.

---

## 2. Grounds for Objection

### 2.1 Incomplete and Inconsistent Disclosure

The Applicant's Form E contains material inconsistencies and omissions that must be resolved before any meaningful FDR can take place:

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Section 1.8 vs 4.6 contradiction** | The Applicant answered "No" to living with a new partner at Q.1.8, but completed Section 4.6 (new partner details), naming Mr Terry Thorne as an occupant |
| **Missing housing costs** | The Applicant's needs schedule (Section 3.1.1) totals £650/month but contains **no provision** for rent, council tax, utilities, or food |
| **Unexplained income** | Bank statements show a payment of £1,912.47 from "M+G Trustee Comp" (4 June 2025) not disclosed in Form E |
| **Undisclosed child asset** | Bank statements show £785 in payments to "Ms C G Kaye" suggesting an undisclosed savings account for Charlotte |
| **Identical declared incomes** | Both the Applicant and Mr Thorne are declared as earning exactly £27,000 - unexplained coincidence |

### 2.2 Questionnaire Outstanding

The Respondent has served a questionnaire seeking clarification of these matters. The Applicant has not yet responded.

Without answers to the questionnaire and production of the requested documents, the court will not have an accurate picture of the Applicant's financial circumstances.

### 2.3 Prejudice to the Respondent

An FDR conducted on incomplete disclosure would prejudice the Respondent because:

1. The Respondent cannot properly assess the Applicant's needs without knowing who pays her housing costs
2. The Respondent cannot evaluate settlement proposals without understanding the Applicant's true financial position
3. Any judicial indication would be based on incomplete information
4. The Respondent would be negotiating at a disadvantage

### 2.4 The Importance of Accurate Disclosure in This Case

This case involves significant pension assets and a dispute about whether those assets are matrimonial or non-matrimonial under *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567.

Under *Standish*, non-matrimonial assets may only be invaded to meet **demonstrated needs**. The Applicant's Form E does not demonstrate any needs - her declared needs of £650/month exclude all essential living costs.

Before the court can assess whether the Applicant has needs justifying invasion of non-matrimonial assets, the court must know:
- What the Applicant's actual needs are
- Who currently meets her housing and living costs
- What Mr Thorne contributes to the household

None of this information is currently available.

## 3. Directions Sought

The Respondent invites the court to:

1. **Refuse** conversion to FDR at this stage

2. **Order** the Applicant to answer the Respondent's questionnaire within 21 days

3. **Order** the Applicant to produce the following documents within 21 days:
   - Tenancy agreement for 12A Newhaven Court
   - Universal Credit award statements from September 2025 to date
   - Any utility bills or council tax demands showing named account holders
   - Documentation relating to the M+G payment of £1,912.47
   - Current statement for any savings account held for Charlotte

4. **List** an FDR appointment after disclosure is complete (not less than 8 weeks)

---

## 4. Summary

The Respondent does not seek to delay these proceedings. The Respondent seeks only to ensure that when an FDR takes place, it is conducted on the basis of full and accurate disclosure by both parties.

An FDR based on incomplete disclosure benefits no one. Any settlement reached would be vulnerable to challenge, and any judicial indication would be unreliable.

The proper course is to give directions for the completion of disclosure, then list an FDR when both parties have complied.

**Statement of Truth**

I believe that the facts stated in this objection are true.
