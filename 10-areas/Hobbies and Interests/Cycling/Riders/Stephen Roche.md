**Stephen Roche** (born November 28, 1959) is an Irish former professional road racing cyclist, best known for his extraordinary achievement in 1987 when he became only the second cyclist in history to win cycling's Triple Crown: the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, and the World Road Race Championship all in the same year. This monumental feat cemented his place among the sport's all-time greats.

Roche's professional career spanned from 1981 to 1993, during which he accumulated 58 professional victories. His 1987 season was a masterclass in consistency, resilience, and tactical brilliance, showcasing his ability to perform at the highest level across different types of races and terrains.

Despite his incredible success, Roche's career was also marked by persistent knee injuries after his Triple Crown year, which significantly impacted his ability to consistently contend for Grand Tour victories. Nevertheless, his legacy as one of Ireland's most celebrated athletes and a true legend of professional cycling remains undiminished, particularly for his unforgettable 1987 season.
