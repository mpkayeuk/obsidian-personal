APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO SERVE EXTENDED QUESTIONNAIRE

Case Number: 1756206544908210
Court: Norwich Combined Court
Applicant: Lenny Timog Kaye
Respondent: Mark Peter Kaye

________________________________________________________________________________

APPLICATION

The Respondent applies pursuant to Practice Direction 27A for permission to serve a questionnaire on the Applicant's Form E that exceeds the usual 4-page limit. The questionnaire is 8 pages in length (12pt font, 1.5 line spacing).

________________________________________________________________________________

GROUNDS

The extended length is necessary because the Applicant's Form E contains:

1. Material internal contradictions requiring clarification (Question 1.8 vs Section 4.6 regarding cohabitation with Mr Terry Thorne)

2. Potentially significant undisclosed assets revealed by bank statements:
    • Payments to the Philippines totalling £3,524.79 (nil disclosed at Section 2.10)
    • Receipt from "M+G Trustee Comp" of £1,912.47 (nil disclosed - potential employee share scheme)
    • Unexplained financial flows to Ms Joylyn Gray (net outflow £10,902.15)

3. Incomplete needs disclosure - Section 3.1.1 declares needs of £650/month with no provision for rent, utilities, food, or other essential costs. This is material to the Standish v Standish [2024] EWCA Civ 567 needs assessment

4. Undisclosed household income and resources - Section 4.6 discloses Mr Thorne's income as £27,000 pa (combined household income ~£54,000) requiring clarification of his contributions to household expenses

5. Other material omissions including Child Benefit (£1,456 pa), credit card payment pattern suggesting liabilities overstated by 42%, and payments to child's savings account

6. Standard disclosure documents outstanding (UC statements, tenancy agreement, utility bills)

The Respondent is a litigant in person and has attempted to limit questions to material issues only. Each question addresses gaps or inconsistencies in the Applicant's Form E or transactions visible in her disclosed bank statements.

________________________________________________________________________________

ORDER SOUGHT

The Respondent invites the court to grant permission to serve the 8-page questionnaire.

In the alternative, if the court considers the questionnaire should be reduced, the Respondent invites the court to indicate which categories of questions should be prioritised or excluded.

STATEMENT OF TRUTH

I believe that the facts stated in this application are true.
