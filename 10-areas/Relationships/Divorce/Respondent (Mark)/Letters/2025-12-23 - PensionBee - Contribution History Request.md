Dear Sir/Madam,

## Subject: Request for Full Contribution History

I am writing to request a complete contribution history for my pension held with PensionBee, referenced above.

This information is required for family court proceedings. Specifically, I require documentation to establish the contribution pattern to this pension over its lifetime.

## Information Requested

Please provide:

1. **Full contribution history** showing every contribution made to this pension from inception to date, including:
   - Date of each contribution
   - Amount of each contribution
   - Source of contribution (personal contribution, transfer-in from previous pension)

2. **Transfer-in details** - please confirm:
   - The date(s) any funds were transferred into PensionBee
   - The value of each transfer
   - The originating pension provider(s)

3. **Fund value at the following dates:**
   - Date account was opened with PensionBee
   - 12 October 2013 (or confirmation if the account did not exist at that date)
   - Current value

4. **Confirmation of any personal contributions** made since the account was opened, as distinct from transferred-in funds.

## Purpose

This information is required for financial remedy proceedings in the Family Court. The contribution history is necessary to establish the character of the pension asset under the principles set out in *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567.

## Consent and Verification

I confirm that I am the account holder and consent to the release of this information. I am happy to provide any additional verification you require.

Please send the documentation to:

[INSERT ADDRESS]

Or by email to: [INSERT EMAIL]

If there is any charge for providing this information, please let me know in advance.

I would be grateful if you could respond within 21 days given the ongoing court proceedings.

Yours faithfully,

---

## Note

PensionBee is a pension consolidation service, so the funds held may have originated from earlier workplace or personal pensions. The contribution history request above asks them to clarify what was transferred in versus what has been contributed directly. If the PensionBee account was opened after October 2013 but the underlying funds originated from pensions that existed before that date, you may also need to request historical records from the original pension providers.
