This document outlines the high-level design and links to detailed design specifications for each phase of the project.

### Design Phases:

1.  [**Define Content & Structure**](1.%20Define%20Content%20&%20Structure/Define%20Content%20&%20Structure.md)
    *   This phase focuses on determining the core message, target audience, and overall layout of the website. It involves outlining the key sections and gathering the necessary content.

2.  [**Development Environment Setup**](2.%20Development%20Environment%20Setup/Development%20Environment%20Setup.md)
    *   Setting up the local development environment and version control to ensure a smooth and collaborative development process.

3.  [**Website Development (Frontend)**](3.%20Website%20Development%20(Frontend)/Website%20Development%20(Frontend).md)
    *   The actual implementation of the website's user interface, ensuring it is responsive, visually appealing, and effectively presents the content.

4.  [**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**](4.%20Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(IaC)/Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20(IaC).md)
    *   Defining and provisioning all necessary cloud infrastructure using code, ensuring repeatability, consistency, and version control of the environment.

5.  [**DevOps & CI/CD**](5.%20DevOps%20&%20CI_CD/DevOps%20&%20CI_CD.md)
    *   Establishing automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying the website, embodying continuous integration and continuous delivery principles.

6.  [**Monitoring & Observability**](6.%20Monitoring%20&%20Observability/Monitoring%20&20Observability.md)
    *   Implementing tools and practices to gain deep insights into the website's performance, availability, and user interactions in real-time.

7.  [**Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Principles**](7.%20Site%20Reliability%20Engineering%20(SRE)%20Principles/Site%20Reliability%20Engineering%20(SRE)%20Principles.md)
    *   Applying SRE methodologies to ensure the long-term reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency of the website.

8.  [**Testing**](8.%20Testing/Testing.md)
    *   Developing and integrating various levels of testing (unit, integration, E2E) to ensure the quality and correctness of the application and infrastructure.

9.  [**Security**](9.%20Security/Security.md)
    *   Implementing robust security measures throughout the application and infrastructure lifecycle to protect against vulnerabilities and threats.

10. [**Documentation**](10.%20Documentation/Documentation.md)
    *   Creating comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the project, from setup and deployment to monitoring and maintenance.
