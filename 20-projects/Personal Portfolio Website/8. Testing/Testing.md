# Testing

## Goal
To develop and integrate various levels of testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure the quality, correctness, and reliability of the application and infrastructure. This helps in catching bugs early and maintaining a high standard of code.

## Detailed Design Steps

### 8.1. Unit Testing
*   **Action:** Write unit tests for individual functions, components, or modules of the application code.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Frameworks:** Jest, React Testing Library (for React), Vitest, Mocha, Chai.
    *   **Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage for critical parts of the application.
    *   **Automation:** Integrate unit tests into the CI pipeline.

### 8.2. Integration Testing
*   **Action:** Write integration tests to verify the interactions between different parts of the application or between the application and external services (e.g., API calls, database interactions).
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Mocking/Stubbing:** Use mocks or stubs for external dependencies to isolate the tests.
    *   **Automation:** Integrate integration tests into the CI pipeline.

### 8.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
*   **Action:** Write E2E tests to simulate real user scenarios and verify the entire application flow from start to finish.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Frameworks:** Cypress, Playwright, Selenium.
    *   **Browser Coverage:** Test across different browsers if necessary.
    *   **Automation:** Integrate E2E tests into the CD pipeline (post-deployment smoke tests).

### 8.4. Infrastructure Testing
*   **Action:** Test the IaC configurations to ensure they provision the infrastructure as expected.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **IaC Linting:** Use tools like `terraform validate`, `tflint`, `checkov` to check for syntax errors and security misconfigurations.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Deploy a test environment with IaC and run automated checks against it.
    *   **Compliance Checks:** Ensure infrastructure adheres to security and compliance policies.

### 8.5. Performance Testing (Basic)
*   **Action:** Conduct basic performance tests to identify bottlenecks and ensure the website can handle expected load.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Tools:** Lighthouse (for web performance), k6, JMeter (for API/load testing if applicable).
    *   **Metrics:** Page load times, response times under load.

### 8.6. Accessibility Testing
*   **Action:** Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Tools:** Lighthouse, Axe DevTools, manual checks.
    *   **Guidelines:** Adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

### 8.7. Security Testing (Basic)
*   **Action:** Perform basic security checks to identify common vulnerabilities.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Scan code for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Scan the running application for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
