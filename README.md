# My Personal Notebook

Welcome to my digital garden. This is a space for my personal notes, thoughts, and ideas.

## How This Vault is Organised

This vault is organised using a combination of folders and tags to make information easy to find and link.

### Folders

*   **/00-inbox**: Fleeting notes and new ideas that haven't been processed yet.
*   **/10-areas**: Broad areas of ongoing responsibility or interest (e.g., Health, Finances, Career).
*   **/20-projects**: Specific, time-bound projects with a clear goal.
*   **/30-resources**: Notes on specific topics, books, articles, or people.
*   **/40-archive**: Completed projects and notes that are no longer active.
*   **/99-templates**: Templates for different types of notes.

### Key Tags

*   `#status/seed`: A new idea or note that needs to be developed.
*   `#status/growing`: A note that is actively being worked on.
*   `#status/evergreen`: A well-developed, core note.
