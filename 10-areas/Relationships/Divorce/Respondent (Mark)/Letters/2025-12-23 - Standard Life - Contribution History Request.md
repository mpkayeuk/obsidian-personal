Dear Sir/Madam,

## Subject: Request for Full Contribution History

I am writing to request a complete contribution history for my pension held with Standard Life, referenced above.

This information is required for family court proceedings. Specifically, I require documentation to establish the contribution pattern to this pension over its lifetime.

## Information Requested

Please provide:

1. **Full contribution history** showing every contribution made to this pension from inception to date, including:
   - Date of each contribution
   - Amount of each contribution
   - Source of contribution (employee, employer, personal, transfer-in)

2. **Fund value at the following dates:**
   - Date of policy inception
   - 12 October 2013 (or nearest available valuation date)
   - Current value

3. **Confirmation of any periods during which no contributions were made**, specifically whether any contributions (employee, employer, or personal) were made between October 2013 and the present date.

4. **Transfer-in details** - if this pension includes any transferred-in funds, please provide the date and value of any transfers received.

## Purpose

This information is required for financial remedy proceedings in the Family Court. The contribution history is necessary to establish the character of the pension asset under the principles set out in *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567.

## Consent and Verification

I confirm that I am the policyholder and consent to the release of this information. I am happy to provide any additional verification you require.

Please send the documentation to:

Or by email to: [INSERT EMAIL]

If there is any charge for providing this information, please let me know in advance.

Yours faithfully,
