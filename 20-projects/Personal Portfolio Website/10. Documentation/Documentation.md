# Documentation

## Goal
To create comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the personal portfolio website project, from setup and deployment to monitoring and maintenance. This ensures maintainability, facilitates knowledge transfer, and supports future enhancements.

## Detailed Design Steps

### 10.4. CI/CD Pipeline Documentation
*   **Action:** Document the CI/CD pipeline workflows and steps.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Pipeline Stages:** Explain each stage (build, test, deploy).
    *   **Triggers:** Document what triggers the pipeline.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Document any environment variables used.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and their resolutions.

### 10.5. Monitoring & Alerting Documentation

    *   **Alerts:** Document alerting thresholds, notification channels, and escalation procedures.

### 10.6. SRE Principles Documentation
*   **Action:** Document the defined SLOs, SLIs, and error budget.
*   **Consideration:** Explain how these are tracked and used for decision-making.

### 10.7. Security Documentation
*   **Action:** Document the security measures implemented.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Security Controls:** List implemented security controls (e.g., HTTPS, CSP).
