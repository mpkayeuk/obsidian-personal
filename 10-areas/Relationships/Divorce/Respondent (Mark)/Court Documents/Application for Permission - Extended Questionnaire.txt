APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO SERVE EXTENDED QUESTIONNAIRE

Case Number: 1756206544908210
Court: Norwich Combined Court
Applicant: Lenny Timog Kaye
Respondent: Mark Peter Kaye

________________________________________________________________________________

APPLICATION

The Respondent applies pursuant to Practice Direction 27A for permission to serve a questionnaire on the Applicant's Form E that exceeds the usual 4-page limit. The questionnaire is 8 pages in length (12pt font, 1.5 line spacing).

________________________________________________________________________________

GROUNDS

The extended length is necessary because the Applicant's Form E contains:

1. Material internal contradictions requiring clarification (Question 1.8 vs Section 4.6 regarding cohabitation with Mr Terry Thorne)

2. Potentially significant undisclosed assets revealed by bank statements:
    • Payments to the Philippines totalling £3,524.79 (nil disclosed at Section 2.10)
    • Receipt from "M+G Trustee Comp" of £1,912.47 (nil disclosed - potential employee share scheme)
    • Unexplained payments to Ms Joylyn Gray totalling £3,122.15 net (excluding acknowledged rent and food)

3. Undisclosed household income and resources - Section 4.6 discloses Mr Thorne's income as £27,000 pa requiring clarification of his contributions to household expenses

4. Other material omissions including Child Benefit (£1,456 pa), credit card payment pattern suggesting liabilities overstated by 42%, and payments to child's savings account

5. Standard disclosure documents outstanding (UC statements, tenancy agreement, utility bills)

The Respondent is a litigant in person and has attempted to limit questions to material issues only. Each question addresses gaps or inconsistencies in the Applicant's Form E or transactions visible in her disclosed bank statements.

________________________________________________________________________________

ORDER SOUGHT

The Respondent invites the court to grant permission to serve the 8-page questionnaire.

In the alternative, if the court considers the questionnaire should be reduced, the Respondent invites the court to indicate which categories of questions should be prioritised or excluded.

I believe that the facts stated in this application are true.
