# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Principles

## Goal
To apply Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) methodologies to ensure the long-term reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency of the personal portfolio website. This involves a data-driven approach to managing service health and performance.

## Detailed Design Steps

### 7.1. Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
*   **Action:** Identify critical user journeys and define measurable metrics (SLIs) and targets (SLOs) for them.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **SLIs:** Availability (e.g., successful HTTP requests), Latency (e.g., page load time, API response time), Throughput (e.g., requests per second), Error Rate (e.g., HTTP 5xx errors).
    *   **SLOs:** Specific targets for SLIs (e.g., 99.9% availability, 95th percentile latency < 500ms).
    *   **User Impact:** Focus on metrics that directly impact user experience.

### 7.2. Establish Error Budgets
*   **Action:** Based on SLOs, calculate an error budget â€“ the maximum allowable downtime or performance degradation over a period.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Decision Making:** Use the error budget to guide decisions on feature development vs. reliability work. If the budget is being consumed too quickly, prioritize reliability.

### 7.3. Implement Automated Healing and Self-Correction (if applicable)
*   **Action:** Design and implement mechanisms for the system to automatically recover from common failures.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Auto-scaling:** Automatically adjust resources based on load.
    *   **Health Checks:** Configure load balancers or container orchestrators to automatically remove unhealthy instances.
    *   **Restart Policies:** For containerized applications, define restart policies.

### 7.4. Conduct Post-Mortems (for significant incidents)
*   **Action:** For any significant outages or performance degradations, conduct a blameless post-mortem.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Learning:** Focus on identifying root causes and implementing preventative measures.
    *   **Documentation:** Document findings and action items.

### 7.5. Capacity Planning (if applicable)
*   **Action:** Forecast future resource needs based on anticipated growth and usage patterns.
*   **Consideration:** Ensure the infrastructure can handle expected traffic spikes.

### 7.6. Reduce Toil through Automation
*   **Action:** Identify repetitive, manual operational tasks and automate them.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Scripting:** Use scripts for routine maintenance.
    *   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate automation into pipelines.

### 7.7. Disaster Recovery Planning (Basic)
*   **Action:** Outline basic steps for recovering the website in case of a major outage (e.g., region failure).
*   **Consideration:** Leverage IaC for rapid re-provisioning in another region.
