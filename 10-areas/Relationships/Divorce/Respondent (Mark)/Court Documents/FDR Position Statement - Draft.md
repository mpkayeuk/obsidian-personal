# FDR Position Statement
## Respondent (Mark Peter Kaye)

**Case Number:** 1756206544908210
**Court:** Norwich Combined Court
**Applicant:** Lenny Timog Kaye
**Respondent:** Mark Peter Kaye

---

## 1. Introduction

1.1 This position statement is filed on behalf of the Respondent in advance of the Financial Dispute Resolution appointment.

1.2 The Respondent seeks a clean break order with no pension sharing, no spousal maintenance in either direction, and dismissal of all financial claims.

1.3 The Respondent's position is that:
- The majority of pension assets are non-matrimonial under *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567
- The Respondent carries 100% of the marital debt (£69,033)
- The net matrimonial asset position is negative
- There is a significant disparity in age and earning capacity that the court must consider under Section 25

## 2. Financial Summary

### 2.1 The Parties' Positions

| Asset/Liability | Respondent (Mark) | Applicant (Lenny) |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Pensions** | £161,390 | £6,580 |
| **Other Assets** | £64 (bank accounts) | £11,565 (car equity, savings) |
| **Liabilities** | £69,033 | Minimal |
| **Net Position** | £92,421 | £18,145 |
| **Annual Income** | £4,716 (UC only) | £27,677 (salary + UC + CMS) |
| **Age** | 51 | 35 |
| **Years to Retirement** | 14 | 32 |

### 2.2 The Apparent Disparity

On the face of it, the Respondent has significantly greater net assets. However, this analysis is misleading for the following reasons:

1. The Respondent's assets are almost entirely illiquid pensions, inaccessible until age 55
2. The majority of those pensions are non-matrimonial (see Section 3 below)
3. The Respondent carries 100% of marital debt that he cannot discharge
4. The Respondent has no earning capacity to service that debt or rebuild assets
5. The Applicant has 32 years of earning capacity and pension accrual ahead of her

---

## 3. Pension Position: *Standish v Standish*

### 3.1 The Legal Principle

In *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567, the Court of Appeal confirmed that **passive growth on non-matrimonial assets remains non-matrimonial**. Where an asset existed before the marriage and no contributions were made during the marriage, the entire current value retains its pre-marital character - not merely the value at the date of marriage.

### 3.2 Application to the Respondent's Pensions

| Pension | CETV | Started Pre-Marriage | Contributions During Marriage | Character |
|---------|------|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| PensionBee | £100,884 | Yes | **None** | Non-matrimonial |
| Standard Life | £28,524 | Yes | **None** | Non-matrimonial |
| Nest | £31,982 | No | Yes | **Matrimonial** |
| **Total** | **£161,390** | | | |

The Respondent's Form E states, in respect of both PensionBee and Standard Life:

> *"This pension was accrued outside the marriage and no contributions made during the marriage."*

This is a sworn statement. Documentary confirmation has been requested from the pension providers and is awaited.

### 3.3 The Non-Matrimonial Portion

If no contributions were made during the marriage (as stated in Form E), then under *Standish*:

- **Non-matrimonial pensions:** £129,408 (PensionBee + Standard Life)
- **Matrimonial pension:** £31,982 (Nest only)

Any claim by the Applicant to share in the non-matrimonial pensions would require her to establish a **need** that cannot be met from matrimonial assets. For the reasons set out below, no such need exists.

---

## 4. Marital Debt

### 4.1 The Debt Position

The Respondent carries **£69,033** of liabilities, all of which are marital debts incurred during the marriage. These are itemised in the Form E Continuation Sheet and verified by Equifax credit report. The debts are currently defaulted.

The Applicant carries **no significant debt**.

### 4.2 The Respondent Cannot Discharge This Debt Through Bankruptcy

The Respondent's only realistic route to income is through self-employment via his limited company (VPTK Services Ltd). This is because:

1. The Respondent is subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) until October 2033
2. The SHPO restrictions make conventional employment effectively impossible (see Section 5 below)
3. Self-employment through his own company is the only viable income route
4. **Bankruptcy would disqualify the Respondent as a company director**
5. This would eliminate his only potential income source

The Respondent is therefore trapped with the debt. He cannot discharge it and must carry it indefinitely on an income of £4,716 per year.

### 4.3 Impact on Net Matrimonial Position

When debt is properly accounted for:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Matrimonial pension (Nest) | £31,982 |
| Less: Marital debt (Respondent) | (£69,033) |
| **Net Matrimonial Position** | **(£37,051)** |

The matrimonial pot is **in deficit by £37,051**. The Respondent is bearing this entire deficit alone. There is nothing to share.

---

## 5. Earning Capacity: SHPO Restrictions

### 5.1 The SHPO

The Respondent is subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order made by Norwich Crown Court on 26 October 2023 (amended 22 November 2023). The order remains in force until **26 October 2033**. The Respondent will be 59 years old when it expires.

### 5.2 Employment-Restricting Prohibitions

The SHPO imposes the following restrictions which make conventional employment impossible:

| Prohibition | Effect on Employment |
|-------------|---------------------|
| All internet-capable devices must be notified to police within 3 days | No employer will permit police access to work devices |
| Devices must retain browsing history and be available for police inspection | Professional confidentiality impossible |
| Monitoring software may be installed by police | Client/employer data security compromised |
| No VPNs, private browsing, or incognito mode | Standard business practices prohibited |
| Social media/messaging accounts must be registered with police | Professional networking severely restricted |
| All cloud storage must be disclosed to police with passwords | Client confidentiality impossible |
| No unsupervised contact with female children under 16 | Entire employment sectors eliminated |

### 5.3 Practical Effect

1. **Corporate employment is impossible.** No employer will hire someone whose work devices are subject to police inspection and monitoring. DBS checks will reveal the conviction.

2. **The Respondent's previous career (IT consulting) is destroyed.** Client confidentiality is fundamentally incompatible with police access to devices and cloud storage.

3. **Self-employment is the only viable option**, but even this is severely constrained. Through his own company, the Respondent does not require employer DBS clearance and can attempt to structure work within the restrictions.

4. **The restrictions continue until the Respondent is 59.** His entire remaining working life is affected.

### 5.4 Section 25 Consideration

The court is required under Section 25(a) MCA 1973 to have regard to *"the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future."*

The Respondent submits that:
- His earning capacity is **nil or negligible** for the foreseeable future
- This position will continue until at least October 2033 (age 59)
- He cannot rebuild pension provision
- His existing pensions are his **only** retirement security
- A pension sharing order would leave him reliant on state pension alone in retirement

---

## 6. Age and Capacity to Rebuild

### 6.1 The Disparity

| Factor | Respondent | Applicant |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Age | 51 | 35 |
| Years to state pension age | 16 | 32 |
| Current employment | None (LCW) | Employed |
| Earning capacity | Nil (SHPO) | Full |
| Ability to accrue pension | None | 32 years |
| Current pension accrual | Nil | Active (employer scheme) |

### 6.2 The Applicant's Position

The Applicant:
- Is 35 years old with 32 years until retirement
- Is currently employed with an income of approximately £20,000 per year
- Has access to an employer pension scheme
- Already holds a PensionBee pension of £6,580
- Has capacity to build substantial pension provision over 32 years
- Has walked away from the marriage debt-free

### 6.3 The Respondent's Position

The Respondent:
- Is 51 years old with 14 years until state pension age
- Has no employment and no realistic prospect of employment until age 59
- Cannot contribute to any pension
- Cannot rebuild any capital
- Carries £69,033 of defaulted marital debt
- Has only £64 in liquid assets
- Will be entirely dependent on his existing pensions in retirement

### 6.4 Effect of Pension Sharing

If the Applicant received (for example) a £40,000 pension share:

| | Respondent | Applicant |
|-|------------|-----------|
| Pension | £121,390 | £46,580 |
| Debt | (£69,033) | £0 |
| **Net** | **£52,357** | **£46,580** |

This appears superficially equal. However:
- The Respondent's £52,357 is **illiquid until age 55**
- The Respondent must service £69,033 debt on £4,716/year income
- The Respondent **cannot add to this provision**
- The Applicant has 32 years to accrue further pension
- The Applicant has no debt
- The Applicant has earning capacity

The practical effect would be to leave the Respondent destitute in retirement while the Applicant can rebuild.

## 7. The Applicant's Disclosure Issues

### 7.1 Form E Contradictions

The Respondent notes the following issues with the Applicant's disclosure:

1. **Section 1.8 vs 4.6 contradiction**: The Applicant answered "No" to living with a new partner at Question 1.8, but completed Section 4.6 (which relates to living with another person). Mr Terry Thorne is listed as an occupant of her address.

2. **Missing housing costs**: The Applicant's income needs schedule (Section 3.1.1) totals £650/month but contains no provision for rent, council tax, utilities, or food. These essential costs are either being met by a third party or have not been disclosed.

3. **Undisclosed receipts**: Bank statements show a payment of £1,912.47 from "M+G Trustee Comp" on 4 June 2025 which is not explained in Form E.

4. **Undisclosed child asset**: Bank statements show £785 in payments to "Ms C G Kaye" referenced as "Savings" and "Child Benefit", suggesting an undisclosed savings account held for Charlotte.

### 7.2 Relevance to Needs

If the Applicant's housing and living costs are being met by a third party (as the missing costs in her needs schedule suggest), her **need** for capital provision from the Respondent is significantly reduced.

---

## 8. Order Sought

The Respondent seeks:

1. **Clean break order** - Dismissal of all financial claims by both parties

2. **No pension sharing order** - On the basis that:
   - £129,408 of the Respondent's pensions are non-matrimonial under *Standish*
   - The only matrimonial pension (£31,982) is exceeded by marital debt (£69,033)
   - The net matrimonial position is negative
   - The Respondent has no capacity to rebuild
   - The Applicant has 32 years of earning capacity

3. **No spousal maintenance** - Neither party to pay maintenance to the other

4. **Each party to retain their own assets and bear their own liabilities**

---

## 9. Summary

| Issue | Respondent's Position |
|-------|----------------------|
| Matrimonial pensions | £31,982 (Nest only) |
| Non-matrimonial pensions | £129,408 (PensionBee + Standard Life) |
| Marital debt carried by Respondent | £69,033 |
| Net matrimonial position | **(£37,051)** |
| Respondent's earning capacity | Nil until 2033 |
| Applicant's earning capacity | Full, 32 years to retirement |
| Can Respondent rebuild? | No |
| Can Applicant rebuild? | Yes |

The Respondent submits that a clean break with no pension sharing is the fair outcome. The matrimonial pot is in deficit, the Respondent is bearing that deficit alone, and he has no capacity to rebuild while the Applicant has 32 years ahead of her.
