**Pedro Delgado Robledo**, affectionately known as "Perico" (born April 15, 1960), is a Spanish former professional road bicycle racer who became a national hero for his aggressive climbing style and his victories in cycling's Grand Tours. He is widely considered a pioneer of modern Spanish cycling.

Delgado's most significant achievements include winning the Tour de France in 1988, a victory that captivated Spain and marked him as a true champion. He also triumphed in his home Grand Tour, the Vuelta a Espa√±a, twice in 1985 and 1989. His career saw him consistently perform at the highest level, finishing in the top 10 of eighteen Grand Tours.

His 1988 Tour de France victory was not without controversy, as he tested positive for Probenecid, a masking agent. However, at the time, the substance was not yet prohibited by the UCI, allowing him to continue racing and ultimately claim his victory. This incident highlighted the evolving landscape of anti-doping regulations in professional cycling.

After retiring from professional cycling, Delgado transitioned into a respected role as a sports commentator, continuing to share his passion and insights for the sport with a new generation of fans.
