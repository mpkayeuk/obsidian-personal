**Mark Simon Cavendish** CH, MBE (born 21 May 1985) is a Manx professional road and track racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Astana Qazaqstan Team. As a road sprinter, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest of all time.

Cavendish has a record of 35 stage wins at the Tour de France, making him the most successful rider in the history of the race in this regard. He also won the points classification in the 2011 and 2021 Tours. In 2011, he became the UCI road race world champion, and has won 17 stages at the Giro d'Italia and three at the Vuelta a Espa√±a.

On the track, Cavendish has won three world championship titles, in the madison with Rob Hayles in 2005, and with Bradley Wiggins in 2008 and 2016.

After a period of illness and poor form, Cavendish made a remarkable comeback in 2021, winning four stages of the Tour de France and the points classification. He had initially planned to retire at the end of the 2023 season, but decided to continue for another year with the Astana Qazaqstan Team with the aim of winning a record-breaking 35th Tour de France stage, a feat he accomplished in 2024.
