**Jonas Vingegaard Hansen** (born December 10, 1996) is a Danish professional road racing cyclist who rides for UCI WorldTeam Visma–Lease a Bike. He is widely recognized as one of the premier climbers and Grand Tour contenders of his generation, known for his quiet demeanor and explosive performances in the mountains.

Vingegaard's career is highlighted by his back-to-back victories in the Tour de France in 2022 and 2023, where he showcased exceptional climbing ability and tactical prowess, often in direct rivalry with Tadej Pogačar. He also secured a victory in the 2025 Vuelta a España, winning three stages, further solidifying his status as a Grand Tour specialist.

Despite a significant setback in 2024 due to a crash that resulted in a punctured lung, Vingegaard demonstrated remarkable resilience by returning to competition and finishing second overall in the 2024 Tour de France, winning a stage in the process. His consistent performance in Grand Tours, including multiple second-place finishes in the Tour de France, underscores his enduring talent.

Awarded the 2023 Vélo d'Or for the best cyclist of the season, Vingegaard continues to be a formidable force in professional cycling, with aspirations to complete his set of Grand Tour victories by competing in the Giro d'Italia in the future.
