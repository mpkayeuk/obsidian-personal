**Lance Edward Armstrong** (born September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist. His career is one of the most celebrated and controversial in the history of sports, marked by unprecedented success followed by a dramatic fall from grace due to doping.

Armstrong rose to international fame by winning the Tour de France a record seven consecutive times from 1999 to 2005. This remarkable achievement came after his successful battle with metastatic testicular cancer, diagnosed in 1996, which he used as a platform to inspire millions through the Lance Armstrong Foundation (now the Livestrong Foundation).

However, his legacy was irrevocably tarnished by persistent doping allegations. In 2012, an investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) concluded that Armstrong had engaged in a sophisticated doping program. As a result, he was stripped of all his Tour de France titles and banned from all sanctioned cycling events. Armstrong publicly confessed to doping in a televised interview in January 2013.

Despite the controversy, Armstrong's early career included a world championship title in 1993 and several significant victories before his cancer diagnosis. His story remains a complex narrative of human triumph, resilience, and profound ethical failure.
