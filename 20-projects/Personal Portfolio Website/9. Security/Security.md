# Security

## Goal
To implement robust security measures throughout the application and infrastructure lifecycle to protect against vulnerabilities, threats, and unauthorized access. This ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the personal portfolio website.

## Detailed Design Steps

### 9.1. Secure Communication (HTTPS)
*   **Action:** Ensure all communication to and from the website uses HTTPS.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **SSL/TLS Certificates:** Obtain and configure SSL/TLS certificates (e.g., from AWS Certificate Manager, Let's Encrypt).
    *   **Force HTTPS:** Configure web servers/CDNs to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

### 9.2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
*   **Action:** Implement a Content Security Policy to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other content injection attacks.
*   **Consideration:** Define allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, etc.

### 9.3. Dependency Security Scanning
*   **Action:** Regularly scan third-party libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Tooling:** Snyk, Dependabot (GitHub), OWASP Dependency-Check.
*   **Automation:** Integrate scanning into the CI pipeline.

### 9.4. Infrastructure Security
*   **Action:** Secure the underlying cloud infrastructure.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to IAM roles/users.
    *   **Network Security:** Configure firewalls/security groups to restrict access to only required ports and IP ranges.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan cloud resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use dedicated services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for storing sensitive information.

### 9.5. Application Security Best Practices
*   **Action:** Follow general application security best practices.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode output to prevent XSS.
    *   **Error Handling:** Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.

### 9.6. Security Headers
*   **Action:** Implement relevant HTTP security headers.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    *   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
    *   `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
    *   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)

### 9.7. Regular Security Audits/Penetration Testing (Optional)
*   **Action:** Periodically conduct security audits or penetration tests.
*   **Consideration:** Identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
