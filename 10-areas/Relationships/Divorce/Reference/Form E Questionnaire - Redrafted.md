| **Critical** | Undisclosed assets (M&G, loan to Gray) | Affects capital position |
| **High** | Universal Credit statements | Documents her income; any inconsistencies will be self-evident |
| **Medium** | Undisclosed income streams | Affects income assessment |
| **Low** | Child Benefit omission | Small sums; disclosure point only |
| **Omit** | Sleeping arrangements, previous occupants | Risk of appearing vexatious |

## Explanatory Notes (Not for Submission)

### Questions Omitted and Reasons

| Original Question | Reason for Omission |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Sleeping arrangements at 12A | Intrusive; unlikely to be ordered; risks appearing vexatious |
| Previous occupants of 12A (Megyn Thorne) | Tangential; investigative rather than disclosure-focused |
| Explanation for late disclosure of Oct/Nov statements | Backward-looking; statements now provided |
| Full details of relationship with Mr Thorne's family | Speculative; better addressed through documents requested |
| Philippines payments (~£270 total) | *De minimis*; unlikely to be material to outcome |
| Declaration to DWP re non-dependent adults | UC statements will show declared household composition |
| Pointed questions about housing element vs rent paid | Risk of appearing accusatory; if there's an inconsistency, the documents will show it |
| Date of notification to DWP of move | Not our concern; we're not DWP investigators |
| Whether rent refund received from previous landlord | Small sum; peripheral |

### Strategic Notes

1. **Focus on documents, not explanations**: The tenancy agreement and UC statements will answer most questions about cohabitation and housing costs without requiring the Applicant to make admissions. Let the documents do the work.

2. **The cohabitation issue**: If she is in a relationship akin to marriage with Mr Thorne and he is subsidising her housing, this is highly material to:
   - Her housing needs (s.25(2)(b))
   - Resources available to her (s.25(2)(a))
   - Any spousal maintenance claim

3. **Universal Credit approach**: We request the statements only. If they show a housing element but her bank statements show no rent being paid, that inconsistency is self-evident. We don't need to make accusations - we simply present the documents at the hearing and let the judge draw inferences. This is more effective than pointed questions which invite defensive, evasive answers.

4. **The M&G payment**: At nearly £2,000, this could indicate an undisclosed pension, investment, or inheritance. Worth pursuing.

5. **The Gray loan**: If she lent £1,000 and only £200 has been repaid, she has an undisclosed asset of ~£800 owed to her.

6. **Tone**: The redrafted questions avoid accusatory language. Courts expect parties to assist with reasonable disclosure, not to conduct cross-examination by questionnaire. Judges are astute - they will notice inconsistencies without needing them signposted aggressively.
