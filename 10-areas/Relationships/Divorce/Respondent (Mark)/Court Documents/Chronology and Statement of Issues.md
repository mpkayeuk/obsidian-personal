## Part B: Statement of Issues

### Issue 1: Pension Sharing - *Standish v Standish* Application

#### 1.1 The Respondent's Position

The Respondent's total pension assets are £161,390 (CETV), comprising:

| Pension | CETV | Matrimonial Character |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| PensionBee | £100,884 | **Non-matrimonial** (pre-marital, no contributions during marriage) |
| Standard Life | £28,524 | **Non-matrimonial** (pre-marital, no contributions during marriage) |
| Nest | £31,982 | **Matrimonial** (accrued during marriage) |

**Legal Framework:**

In *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567, the Court of Appeal confirmed:

1. Passive growth on pre-marital assets retains its non-matrimonial character
2. Where an asset existed before marriage and no contributions were made during the marriage, the entire current value is non-matrimonial (not merely the date of marriage value)
3. Non-matrimonial assets may only be invaded to meet **demonstrated needs** that cannot be met from matrimonial assets or the claimant's own resources
4. The burden of demonstrating such needs rests with the party seeking to invade non-matrimonial assets

**Application to This Case:**

- £129,408 of the Respondent's pensions are non-matrimonial under *Standish*
- Only £31,982 (Nest) is matrimonial
- The Applicant bears the burden of demonstrating needs that justify invading the non-matrimonial pensions
- **The Applicant has not discharged this burden** (see Issue 2 below)

#### 1.2 The Net Matrimonial Position

When marital debt is properly accounted for:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Matrimonial pension (Nest) | £31,982 |
| Less: Marital debt (borne entirely by Respondent) | (£69,033) |
| **Net Matrimonial Position** | **(£37,051)** |

**The matrimonial pot is in deficit by £37,051.** There is nothing to share. The Respondent is bearing this entire deficit alone.

#### 1.3 Questions for Determination

1. Does the court accept that PensionBee and Standard Life are non-matrimonial under *Standish*?
2. Has the Applicant demonstrated needs that justify invading non-matrimonial assets?
3. Should the negative net matrimonial position (£-37,051) result in a nil pension sharing order?

---

### Issue 2: The Applicant's Needs - Incomplete Disclosure

#### 2.1 The Declared Position

The Applicant's Form E Section 3.1.1 (Income needs: details of expenses) declares total monthly needs of **£650.00**, comprising:
- Mobile phone
- Holidays/outings
- Petrol
- Car insurance

**No provision is made for:**
- Rent (despite declaring rent of £500/month at Section 2.1)
- Council tax
- Gas, electricity, water
- Food and groceries
- Internet/broadband
- Clothing
- Household goods

#### 2.2 The Contradiction

The Applicant's Form E contains an internal contradiction:

| Section | Question | Answer |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Q.1.8 | "Are you living with a new partner?" | **No** |
| Section 4.6 | Partner/cohabitant disclosure | **Completed** (Mr Terry Thorne, occupant, income £27,000 pa) |

Section 4.6 is headed: *"If you have subsequently married or formed a civil partnership (or intend to) or are living with another person (or intend to), give brief details..."*

The completion of Section 4.6 is inconsistent with the "No" answer at Question 1.8.

#### 2.3 The Combined Household Income

If the Applicant is cohabiting with Mr Terry Thorne (as Section 4.6 suggests), the household position is:

| Income Source | Amount (pa) |
|---------------|-------------|
| Applicant's salary (PsychUK) | £27,000 |
| Mr Thorne's income (per s.4.6) | £27,000 |
| Universal Credit (if still claimed) | ~£5,000 |
| Child Maintenance from Respondent | £365 |
| **Combined Household Income** | **~£59,000+** |

This is **twelve times** the Respondent's income of £4,716 pa.

#### 2.4 Bank Statement Evidence

The Applicant's bank statements for September-December 2025 show:
- No rent payments after 13 November 2024 (date of move to current address)
- No deposit or agency fee payments
- No regular utility bill payments
- No council tax payments

This supports the inference that housing costs are being met by Mr Thorne or another third party.

#### 2.5 Outstanding Disclosure

The Respondent has requested the following documents to clarify the Applicant's true financial position:

1. Tenancy agreement for 12A Newhaven Court
2. Universal Credit award statements (September 2025 to date)
3. Utility bills or council tax demands showing named account holders
4. Bank statements for any joint account with Mr Thorne
5. Mr Thorne's payslips or P60 (to verify declared income of £27,000)

#### 2.6 Questions for Determination

1. What are the Applicant's true monthly living costs?
2. Who is meeting her housing and essential living costs?
3. What contribution does Mr Thorne make to the household?
4. What is the combined household income available to meet the Applicant's needs?
5. Has the Applicant demonstrated any needs that cannot be met from her own resources or from the combined household income of ~£59,000?

### Issue 3: Undisclosed Philippines Property

#### 3.1 The Evidence

**Applicant's verbal disclosure (February 2024):**
- The Applicant informed the Respondent in February 2024 that she was purchasing land in the Philippines

**Bank statement evidence:**
- August 2024 - October 2025: £3,524.79 sent to Philippines via three routes:
  - Remitly (direct transfers): £876.79
  - Via Joylyn Gray (payments marked "PH"): £571.00
  - Via Lucy Timog (payments marked "PH", "PH Budget", "Utang"): £2,308.00

**Form E disclosure:**
- Section 2.10 (property outside England and Wales): **No disclosure**

#### 3.2 The Issue

If the Applicant has purchased property in the Philippines:

1. It is an undisclosed asset that should have been declared at Form E Section 2.10
2. The current value and ownership structure are unknown
3. Any equity in the property is part of the matrimonial pot
4. The source of funds for the purchase (£3,525+ from UK bank account) suggests the Applicant had greater financial capacity during the relevant period than her Form E suggests

If the payments are merely family remittances:

1. The quantum is significant (average £235/month over 15 months)
2. This represents a material outgoing that affects the Applicant's claimed needs
3. The Applicant's capacity to remit £235/month while declaring needs of only £650/month (excluding housing) suggests either significant undisclosed income or that her declared needs are artificially low

#### 3.3 Questions for Determination

1. Has the Applicant purchased property in the Philippines?
2. If so, what is its value and why was it not disclosed in Form E?
3. If the payments are family remittances only, what is the source of funds and why does the Applicant claim she cannot meet her own needs from £27,000 salary + UC + child maintenance?

---

### Issue 4: Joylyn Gray Transactions - Undisclosed Assets or Liabilities

#### 4.1 The Pattern

Bank statements show the following financial flows between the Applicant and Joylyn Gray (September 2024 - December 2025):

**Legitimate and Explained:**
- Rent ("House"): £7,000 out (14 months @ £500)
- Food: £1,600 out, £17 in (£200/month from April 2025; previously included in rent)

**Unexplained Net Outflow:**
- "Citizenship": £1,535 out, £200 in = **£1,335 unaccounted**
- "Cashpal": £500 out, £400 in = **£100 net** (pattern suggests cash banking)
- "Lucy Payment": £490 out (routed via Joy for Applicant's sister)
- Philippines ("PH"): £571 out (routed via Joy)
- Shopping: £807 in (reimbursements)
- Miscellaneous: Various small transactions

**Total net outflow excluding rent and food: £3,122.15**

#### 4.2 The Issues

This asymmetrical pattern demands explanation. The Applicant must be either:

1. **Holding undisclosed assets:** Joy is banking money or holding assets on the Applicant's behalf (undisclosed in Form E)
2. **Carrying undisclosed liabilities:** The Applicant owes Joy money (undisclosed debt in Form E)
3. **Purchasing goods/services:** The Applicant received £3,122 worth of goods or services from Joy (not disclosed in needs schedule)

The "Citizenship" payments are particularly suspicious:
- £1,535 total paid out (three separate payments: £1,000, £500, £35)
- Only £200 returned (marked "Loan")
- **£1,335 unaccounted for**
- No citizenship application or fees disclosed in Form E

#### 4.3 The Food Charge Change

The appearance of a separate £200/month "Food" charge from April 2025 is significant:

1. The Applicant started employment with PsychUK in April 2025 (first salary 25 April)
2. Food had previously been included in the £500 rent
3. The rental arrangement appears to have changed once the Applicant had income
4. This goes to credibility: if the Applicant's needs were genuinely £650/month (excluding housing), why did Joy start charging for food the moment the Applicant became employed?

#### 4.4 Questions for Determination

1. What did the Applicant receive in exchange for the £3,122 net outflow to Joy (excluding rent and food)?
2. Is Joy holding money or assets on the Applicant's behalf?
3. Does the Applicant owe Joy money that should be disclosed as a liability in Form E?
4. What were the "Citizenship" payments for, and why has only £200 been returned out of £1,535?
5. Why did food become a separate charge in April 2025 when the Applicant gained employment?

### Issue 5: Other Undisclosed Items

#### 5.1 M&G Payment (£1,912.47)

- Bank statements show receipt of £1,912.47 from "M+G Trustee Comp" on 4 June 2025
- Not disclosed in Form E Section 2.7 (income other than earnings) or Section 2.15 (other income, assets or benefits)
- Nature of payment unknown
- Whether tax paid unknown
- Whether further payments expected unknown

#### 5.2 Charlotte's Savings Account

- Bank statements show £785 in payments to "Ms C G Kaye" referenced as "Savings" and "Child Benefit"
- Pattern: £25/month regular payments plus £435 lump sum
- No savings account for Charlotte disclosed in Form E Section 2.2 (bank accounts)
- As Charlotte is a child, any account must be held by a parent or guardian
- If the Applicant holds this account, it is an undisclosed asset (even if held on trust for Charlotte)

#### 5.3 Child Benefit

- Bank statements show Child Benefit receipts (approximately £26/month visible)
- Not disclosed in Form E Section 2.7 (income other than earnings) or Section 2.15 (other income)
- Child Benefit is approximately £25.60/week (£1,331 pa) for one child
- Small omission but contributes to pattern of incomplete disclosure

### Issue 6: Earning Capacity and Capacity to Rebuild

#### 6.1 The Disparity

| Factor | Respondent | Applicant |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Age | 51 | 35 |
| Years to state pension age | 16 | 32 |
| Current employment | None | Employed (£27,000 pa) |
| Earning capacity | **Nil** (SHPO restrictions) | **Full** |
| Ability to accrue pension | None | 32 years |
| Current pension contributions | Nil | Active (employer scheme) |
| Partner income | N/A | £27,000 (Mr Thorne) |

#### 6.2 The SHPO Restrictions

The Respondent is subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order until 26 October 2033 (when he will be 59 years old). The SHPO imposes restrictions that make conventional employment impossible:

| Prohibition | Effect on Employment |
|-------------|---------------------|
| All internet devices must be notified to police within 3 days | No employer will permit police access to work devices |
| Devices must retain browsing history and be available for inspection | Professional confidentiality impossible |
| Police may install monitoring software | Client/employer data security compromised |
| No VPNs, private browsing, or incognito mode | Standard business practices prohibited |
| Social media/messaging accounts must be registered with police | Professional networking restricted |
| All cloud storage must be disclosed with passwords | Client confidentiality impossible |
| No unsupervised contact with female children under 16 | Entire employment sectors eliminated |

**Practical effect:**

1. Corporate employment is impossible (DBS checks, police access to devices incompatible with any employer's requirements)
2. The Respondent's previous IT consulting career is destroyed (client confidentiality incompatible with SHPO)
3. Self-employment via VPTK Services Ltd is the only viable income route
4. Bankruptcy would disqualify the Respondent as a company director, eliminating this only option
5. The Respondent must therefore carry the £69,033 marital debt indefinitely on £4,716/year income

#### 6.3 Section 25(a) MCA 1973

The court is required to have regard to the income, earning capacity, and financial resources each party has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future.

**Respondent's Position:**
- Earning capacity: nil until October 2033 (age 59)
- Cannot rebuild pension provision
- Existing pensions are his **only** retirement security
- Carries 100% of marital debt (£69,033) with no means to discharge it
- Liquid assets: £64

**Applicant's Position:**
- Earning capacity: full, with 32 years to state pension age
- Currently employed (£27,000 pa)
- Access to employer pension scheme
- Already holds PensionBee pension (£6,580 CETV)
- Can build substantial pension provision over 32 years
- Lives in household with combined income ~£59,000
- Has walked away from marriage debt-free
- Liquid assets: £11,565 (car equity, savings)

#### 6.4 Effect of Pension Sharing - Illustrative Example

If the Applicant received (for example) a £40,000 pension share:

| | Respondent | Applicant |
|-|------------|-----------|
| Pension (after PSO) | £121,390 | £46,580 |
| Less: Debt | (£69,033) | £0 |
| **Net position** | **£52,357** | **£46,580** |
| **Can rebuild?** | **No** (59 when SHPO expires) | **Yes** (32 years to retirement) |
| **Liquid assets** | £64 | £11,565 |

This appears superficially equal, but:
- The Respondent's £52,357 is illiquid until age 55
- The Respondent must service £69,033 debt on £4,716/year income
- The Respondent **cannot add** to this provision
- The Applicant has 32 years to accrue further pension
- The Applicant has full earning capacity
- The Applicant has no debt

**The practical effect would be to leave the Respondent destitute in retirement while the Applicant can rebuild.**

#### 6.5 Questions for Determination

1. What weight should the court give to the 16-year age gap and earning capacity disparity?
2. Should the court take into account the Respondent's inability to rebuild pension provision when determining pension sharing?
3. Is it fair and necessary for the Applicant to receive a share of the Respondent's non-matrimonial pensions when she has 32 years of earning capacity to build her own provision?

---

### Issue 7: Summary of Disclosure Deficiencies

The following items require clarification or documentary production before the court can properly assess the Applicant's needs and determine a fair financial settlement:

| Issue | Form E Section | Status | Materiality |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| Living with partner (1.8 vs 4.6 contradiction) | 1.8 and 4.6 | Contradictory | **CRITICAL** - affects needs assessment and UC entitlement |
| Housing costs absent from needs schedule | 3.1.1 | Missing | **CRITICAL** - £0 declared for rent, utilities, food, clothing |
| Philippines property | 2.10 | Not disclosed | **CRITICAL** - £3,525 sent; verbal disclosure Feb 2024; potential material asset |
| M&G payment £1,912.47 | 2.7 or 2.15 | Not disclosed | **HIGH** - unexplained capital receipt |
| Joy Gray transactions (£3,122 net out) | Various | Not disclosed | **HIGH** - "Citizenship" £1,335 unaccounted; "Cashpal" pattern suspicious |
| Charlotte's savings account | 2.2 | Not disclosed | **MEDIUM** - £785 total; shows financial capacity |
| Child Benefit | 2.7 or 2.15 | Not disclosed | **LOW** - £1,331 pa; small but contributes to pattern |
| Tenancy agreement | Not applicable | Not produced | **CRITICAL** - needed to verify housing costs and named tenant |
| Universal Credit statements | Not applicable | Not produced | **CRITICAL** - needed to verify household composition and UC entitlement |
| Mr Thorne's income verification | 4.6 | Not verified | **HIGH** - £27,000 declared but not verified; determines household income |

## Part C: The Respondent's Case Summary

### The Legal Position

Under *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567:

1. £129,408 of the Respondent's pensions are non-matrimonial (PensionBee + Standard Life)
2. Only £31,982 (Nest) is matrimonial
3. The matrimonial pot is **in deficit** when marital debt is accounted for: £31,982 - £69,033 = **-£37,051**
4. Non-matrimonial assets may only be invaded to meet **demonstrated needs**
5. **The burden is on the Applicant** to demonstrate such needs

### The Applicant Has Not Demonstrated Needs

The Applicant:
- Declares needs of only £650/month (excluding all essential living costs)
- Lives in a household with combined income of approximately £59,000 per annum
- Has full earning capacity with 32 years to build pension provision
- Has walked away from the marriage debt-free with £11,565 in liquid assets
- Has not quantified any retirement capital requirement
- Has not explained how she currently meets her housing and living costs

### The Respondent Cannot Rebuild

The Respondent:
- Is 51 years old with only 16 years to state pension age
- Has no earning capacity until October 2033 (when he will be 59) due to SHPO restrictions
- Carries £69,033 of defaulted marital debt on income of £4,716 per annum
- Cannot discharge the debt through bankruptcy (would lose director status and only income route)
- Cannot contribute to any pension
- Has only £64 in liquid assets
- Will be entirely dependent on his existing pensions in retirement

### The Order Sought

The Respondent seeks:

1. **Clean break order** with dismissal of all financial claims by both parties
2. **No pension sharing order** on the basis that:
   - £129,408 of the Respondent's pensions are non-matrimonial under *Standish*
   - The matrimonial pension (£31,982) is exceeded by marital debt (£69,033)
   - The net matrimonial position is negative (-£37,051)
   - The Applicant has not demonstrated needs justifying invasion of non-matrimonial assets
   - The Respondent has no capacity to rebuild; the Applicant has 32 years
3. **No spousal maintenance** in either direction
4. **Each party to retain their own assets and bear their own liabilities**

### Disclosure Required Before Settlement Can Be Explored

Before any meaningful settlement discussion can take place, the Applicant must provide:

1. Answers to the Respondent's questionnaire
2. Tenancy agreement for current address
3. Universal Credit award statements (September 2025 to date)
4. Utility bills and council tax demands showing named account holders
5. Documentation regarding Philippines property (if any) or explanation of Philippines payments
6. Documentation regarding M&G payment (£1,912.47)
7. Explanation of Joylyn Gray transactions (particularly "Citizenship" and "Cashpal")
8. Bank statements for any joint account with Mr Thorne
9. Mr Thorne's income verification (payslips/P60)

**Without this disclosure, the court cannot properly assess the Applicant's needs or determine whether invasion of the Respondent's non-matrimonial assets is justified.**
