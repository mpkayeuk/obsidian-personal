**Case Number:** 1756206544908210
**Court:** Norwich Combined Court
**Applicant:** Lenny Timog Kaye
**Respondent:** Mark Peter Kaye

---

## Purpose

The Respondent files this short note to place on record the Applicant's current financial position as disclosed in her Form E dated 23 December 2025.

This note is filed to create a contemporaneous record before any further directions hearings or FDR appointment.

## The Applicant's Current Position (as at 23 December 2025)

### 1. Declared Income Needs

The Applicant's Form E, Section 3.1.1 (Income needs: details of expenses) declares total monthly needs of **£650.00**.

The declared needs comprise:
- Mobile phone
- Holidays/outings
- Petrol
- Car insurance

### 2. Material Omissions from Needs Schedule

The Applicant's needs schedule contains **no provision** for the following essential living costs:
- Rent or mortgage payments
- Council tax
- Gas, electricity, or water
- Food and groceries
- Internet or broadband
- Clothing
- Household goods

### 3. Bank Statement Evidence

The Applicant's bank statements for the period September-December 2025 show:
- No rent payments after 13 November 2025 (date of move to current address)
- No deposit or agency fee payments in connection with the move
- No regular utility bill payments

### 4. Form E Contradictions

The Applicant's Form E contains the following apparent contradiction:

| Section | Question | Answer |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Q.1.8 | "Are you living with a new partner?" | **No** |
| Section 4.6 | Partner/cohabitant disclosure | **Completed** (Mr Terry Thorne, income £27,000 pa) |

Section 4.6 is headed: *"If you have subsequently married or formed a civil partnership (or intend to) or are living with another person (or intend to), give brief details..."*

The completion of Section 4.6 is inconsistent with the "No" answer at Question 1.8.

## Outstanding Disclosure

The Respondent has served a questionnaire dated [INSERT DATE] seeking clarification of these matters and requesting production of the following documents:

1. Universal Credit award statements (September 2025 to date)
2. Tenancy agreement for current address
3. Utility bills or council tax demands showing named account holders
4. Other financial documents

These documents will clarify:
- The Applicant's housing arrangements and costs
- Whether housing costs are being met by a third party
- The household composition declared to the Department for Work and Pensions
- The Applicant's true monthly expenditure

## Purpose of This Note

The Respondent makes no application at this stage. This note is filed solely to **create a contemporaneous record** of the Applicant's disclosed position as at 23 December 2025, before any further hearing takes place.

The Respondent notes that:

1. The Applicant's Form E is a **sworn statement** made under penalty of contempt of court

2. The declared needs of £650 per month (excluding all housing and essential living costs) represent the Applicant's sworn position as at the date of filing

3. This position is directly relevant to the issue of **demonstrated needs** under the principles established in *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567

4. Any subsequent material change to the Applicant's declared needs (whether by way of "correction" or "updated schedule") will require:
   - Documentary evidence from the period **September 2025 to January 2026** (contemporaneous with Form E)
   - Explanation under oath of why the Form E sworn statement was inaccurate or incomplete
   - The court to consider the credibility and weight to be given to such retrospective changes

5. The Respondent **reserves the right** to challenge any uplift in the Applicant's declared needs as:
   - Non-contemporaneous with the Form E filing date
   - Reactive to the Respondent's questionnaire rather than genuine
   - Inconsistent with bank statement evidence from September-December 2025
   - Inconsistent with any Universal Credit declarations made during the same period

---

## The Legal Context

Under *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567, non-matrimonial assets may only be invaded to meet **demonstrated needs** that cannot be met from matrimonial assets or the claimant's own resources.

The burden of demonstrating such needs rests with the party seeking to invade non-matrimonial assets (see *Standish* at [48]-[52]).

The Respondent's position is that:
- The majority of his pension assets (£129,408 out of £161,390) are non-matrimonial
- The Applicant has not demonstrated needs in her Form E (£650/month excluding essential costs)
- The Applicant's household income is approximately £54,000 per annum (her salary £27,000 plus Mr Thorne's income £27,000, both declared at Section 4.6)
- The Applicant has 32 years of earning capacity to build her own pension provision

The Respondent submits that the Applicant's **current disclosed position** (£650/month needs, household income ~£54,000) does not establish any needs that would justify invasion of non-matrimonial assets.

This note preserves the evidential position as it currently stands.

## Summary

The Respondent asks the court to note:

1. The Applicant's sworn Form E dated 23 December 2025 declares needs of £650 per month

2. This figure excludes rent, council tax, utilities, food, and all other essential living costs

3. The Applicant's bank statements show no rent payments or housing costs after 13 November 2025

4. The Applicant has completed partner disclosure for Mr Thorne (income £27,000) despite answering "No" to living with a new partner

5. Outstanding disclosure will clarify the true position

6. Any retrospective uplift in declared needs should be treated with caution and will require contemporaneous documentary evidence

The Respondent makes no application and seeks no order at this stage.
