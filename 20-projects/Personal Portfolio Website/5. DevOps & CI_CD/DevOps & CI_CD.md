# DevOps & CI/CD

## Goal
To establish automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying the personal portfolio website, embodying continuous integration and continuous delivery principles. This ensures rapid, reliable, and repeatable software releases.

## Detailed Design Steps

### 5.1. Choose CI/CD Platform
*   **Action:** Select a platform to host and execute the CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **GitHub Actions:** Tightly integrated with GitHub repositories, YAML-based workflows.
    *   **GitLab CI:** Integrated with GitLab, powerful YAML-based pipelines.
    *   **Jenkins:** Self-hosted, highly customizable, extensive plugin ecosystem.
    *   **AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild:** Cloud-native options for AWS users.
    *   **Azure DevOps Pipelines:** Cloud-native options for Azure users.

### 5.2. Define CI Pipeline (Continuous Integration)
*   **Action:** Design the steps for the continuous integration process.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Trigger:** On every push to a feature branch or pull request.
    *   **Build:** Compile frontend assets (e.g., `npm run build`, `hugo`).
    *   **Linting/Static Analysis:** Run code quality checks (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, linters for IaC).
    *   **Unit Tests:** Execute unit tests for application code.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Run tests that verify interactions between components.
    *   **Artifact Creation:** Package the built website (e.g., a `.zip` file, Docker image if applicable).

### 5.3. Define CD Pipeline (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)
*   **Action:** Design the steps for the continuous delivery/deployment process.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Trigger:** On successful completion of CI pipeline on a main branch (e.g., `main`, `master`).
    *   **IaC Plan:** Run `terraform plan` or `pulumi preview` to show infrastructure changes.
    *   **Deployment:** Deploy the built artifact to the cloud infrastructure (e.g., sync to S3 bucket, update CloudFront invalidation, deploy new container).
    *   **Post-Deployment Tests:** Run smoke tests or basic end-to-end tests on the deployed application.
    *   **Rollback Strategy:** Define procedures for quickly reverting to a previous stable version in case of issues.

### 5.4. Implement Pipeline as Code
*   **Action:** Define CI/CD pipelines using configuration files (e.g., YAML) stored in the Git repository.
*   **Consideration:** Treat pipeline definitions as code, subject to version control, reviews, and testing.

### 5.5. Environment Management
*   **Action:** Define different deployment environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`).
*   **Consideration:** Use environment-specific variables and configurations within the pipelines.

### 5.6. Notifications and Feedback
*   **Action:** Configure notifications for pipeline status (success/failure).
*   **Consideration:** Integrate with communication tools (e.g., Slack, email).
