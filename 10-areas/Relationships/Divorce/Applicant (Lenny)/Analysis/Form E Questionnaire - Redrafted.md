# Form E Questionnaire
## Prioritised Questions for the Applicant

---

### Materiality Analysis

| Priority | Issue | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Critical** | Form E internal contradictions (1.8 vs 4.6) | Goes to credibility; she denies living with partner but completes partner disclosure section |
| **Critical** | Missing housing costs in needs schedule | Her needs omit rent, utilities, food - suggests costs being met by third party; **undermines any claim to invade non-matrimonial assets for "needs"** |
| **Critical** | Terry Thorne's income and contributions | Both declare exactly £27,000 income (suspicious); combined household income ~£54,000 yet needs schedule only £650/month |
| **Critical** | Asymmetrical payments to/from Joylyn Gray | £13,502.77 out vs £1,780.62 in = £11,722.15 net out; suggests either (a) undisclosed assets held by Joy, (b) undisclosed debt to Joy, or (c) unexplained financial support |
| **Critical** | Undisclosed assets (M&G, payments to Gray) | Affects capital position; £1,535 paid for "Citizenship" with only £200 returned |
| **High** | Failure to demonstrate needs | Under *Standish*, non-matrimonial assets can only be invaded for demonstrated needs; she hasn't shown any |
| **Medium** | Charlotte's savings account | £785 total payments; undisclosed child asset |
| **High** | PensionBee "in drawdown" at age 35 | Unusual; may explain M&G payment; needs clarification |
| **High** | Universal Credit statements | Documents her income; any inconsistencies will be self-evident |
| **Medium** | Undisclosed income streams | Affects income assessment |
| **Low** | Child Benefit omission | Small sums; disclosure point only |
| **Omit** | Sleeping arrangements, previous occupants | Risk of appearing vexatious |

### 4. Pensions & Undisclosed Assets

**4.1** The supplementary page to your Form E discloses a PensionBee pension (reference 1859924) with a cash equivalent of £6,580.14. At the question "Is the pension in payment or drawdown?" you have answered "Yes."

## Explanatory Notes (Not for Submission)

### New Questions Added Following Form E Review

| New Question | Basis | Why Material |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| 1.1 (Section 1.8 vs 4.6) | Form E shows "No" to living with partner at 1.8, but Section 4.6 completed | Internal contradiction goes to credibility |
| 1.2 (Missing housing costs) | Section 3.1.1 needs schedule omits rent, utilities, food | Either costs met by third party or incomplete disclosure |
| 3.1 (Pension drawdown) | PensionBee marked "in drawdown" at age 35 | Highly unusual; may explain M&G payment |

### Questions Updated Following Bank Statement Forensic Analysis

| Question | Update | Basis |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 3.3 (Payments to Gray) | Expanded from £1,000 to £1,535 | Bank statements show three "Citizenship" payments: £500 (22 Apr), £35 (23 Apr), £1,000 (6 Jun) |
| 5.1 (Payments from Gray) | Added references and 5 Sep payment | References show "Shopping", "Personal Expenses", "Loan", "Cashpal" |
| 3.4 (Charlotte savings) | **NEW** | £785 total to "Ms C G Kaye" (14 × £25 "Savings" + £435 "Child Benefit") - undisclosed child asset |
| 6.2 (Asymmetrical payments) | **NEW - CRITICAL** | Comprehensive analysis reveals £13,502.77 out vs £1,780.62 in = £11,722.15 net outflow; even excluding rent/food, net out is £3,139.15; suggests undisclosed assets held by Joy OR undisclosed debt to Joy |

### Questions Omitted and Reasons

| Original Question | Reason for Omission |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Sleeping arrangements at 12A | Intrusive; unlikely to be ordered; risks appearing vexatious |
| Previous occupants of 12A (Megyn Thorne) | Tangential; investigative rather than disclosure-focused |
| Explanation for late disclosure of Oct/Nov statements | Backward-looking; statements now provided |
| Full details of relationship with Mr Thorne's family | Speculative; better addressed through documents requested |
| Philippines payments (~£450 total) | Categorised as "PH" - likely family remittances; not material to outcome |
| Declaration to DWP re non-dependent adults | UC statements will show declared household composition |
| Pointed questions about UC housing element vs rent | Risk of appearing accusatory; documents will show it |
| Nature of relationship with Mr Thorne | Asked neutrally at 1.1; her answer to Form E contradiction will reveal this |
| "Food" payments from April 2025 | £200/month labeled "Food" from Apr 2025 is noted but hard to frame as question without speculation; may have innocent explanation |
| Lucy Timog payments (net £2,238) | Payments to/from sister appear to be informal family arrangements; not material |

### Strategic Notes

1. **Lead with the Form E contradictions**: Questions 1.1 and 1.2 are now first because they arise directly from her own sworn disclosure. You're not making accusations - you're asking her to explain inconsistencies in her own document. This is hard to criticise.

2. **The missing housing costs point is very strong**: It's factual and non-accusatory. Everyone has rent/utilities/food costs. Either she pays them (and should have disclosed them) or she doesn't (and someone else is subsidising her). The question lets her explain without pre-judging.

3. **The pension drawdown question**: This is unusual enough to warrant inquiry. If it's a form-filling error, she can say so. If she genuinely accessed pension funds early, the court needs to know how and why - and whether the M&G payment relates to it.

4. **Focus on documents, not explanations**: The tenancy agreement, UC statements, and utility bills will answer most questions without requiring admissions. Let the documents do the work.

5. **Tone**: The questions are neutral and reference specific Form E sections. This demonstrates you've reviewed her disclosure carefully and are seeking clarification of genuine gaps, not conducting harassment.

6. **The cohabitation issue**: Note that Question 1.1 does not directly ask "Are you in a relationship with Mr Thorne?" Instead, it asks her to explain her own contradictory answers. This is more effective - she must either:
   - Admit 1.8 was wrong (she is living with a partner), or
   - Explain why she completed 4.6 if she's not

   Either answer advances your position.

7. **The asymmetrical payments question (6.2) is the most powerful disclosure tool**: The net outflow of £11,722.15 to Joy demands explanation. This is not a normal financial pattern. She must explain:
   - If Joy is holding assets for her → undisclosed assets in Form E
   - If she owes Joy money → undisclosed liability in Form E
   - If neither → what did she receive for £11,722 net outflow?

   **She cannot answer this question without either:**
   (a) Admitting Form E is materially incomplete, OR
   (b) Providing documentation that will reveal her true financial position

   Even excluding rent and food (£8,600), the net outflow of £3,139 has no obvious explanation from the bank statements. The "Citizenship" payments (£1,535 out, £200 back) are particularly suspicious.
