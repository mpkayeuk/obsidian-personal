**Gregory James LeMond** (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist, widely regarded as one of the greatest American cyclists of all time and a pivotal figure in the sport's history. He was the first non-European to win the Tour de France, a feat he accomplished three times.

LeMond's career was marked by both incredible success and significant adversity. He won the Tour de France in 1986, 1989, and 1990. His 1989 victory is particularly legendary, as he overcame a 50-second deficit to Laurent Fignon on the final day's individual time trial to win by a mere 8 seconds, the smallest margin in Tour history. He also won the Road Race World Championship twice, in 1983 and 1989.

His career was tragically interrupted by a near-fatal hunting accident in 1987, where he was shot with a shotgun. Despite carrying numerous lead pellets in his body, he made a remarkable comeback to win two more Tours de France, showcasing immense resilience and determination. LeMond was also a vocal advocate against doping in cycling, a stance that often put him at odds with powerful figures in the sport.
