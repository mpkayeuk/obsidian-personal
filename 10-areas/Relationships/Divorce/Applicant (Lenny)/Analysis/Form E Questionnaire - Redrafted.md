# Form E Questionnaire
## Prioritised Questions for the Applicant

---

### Materiality Analysis

| Priority | Issue | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Critical** | Form E internal contradictions (1.8 vs 4.6) | Goes to credibility; she denies living with partner but completes partner disclosure section |
| **Critical** | Missing housing costs in needs schedule | Her needs omit rent, utilities, food - suggests costs being met by third party; **undermines any claim to invade non-matrimonial assets for "needs"** |
| **Critical** | Terry Thorne's income and contributions | Both declare exactly £27,000 income (suspicious); combined household income ~£54,000 yet needs schedule only £650/month |
| **High** | Food charge starting April 2025 | £200/month "Food" charge appears April 2025 (coinciding with new employment); if food was previously included in £500 rent, why separate charge? Suggests needs may be understated |
| **Critical** | Asymmetrical payments to/from Joylyn Gray (excluding rent/food) | Even excluding legitimate rent and food, £4,902.77 out vs £1,780.62 in = £3,122.15 net out; suggests either (a) undisclosed assets held by Joy, (b) undisclosed debt to Joy, or (c) unexplained cash movements |
| **Critical** | Undisclosed assets (M&G, payments to Gray) | Affects capital position; £1,535 paid for "Citizenship" with only £200 returned |
| **High** | Failure to demonstrate needs | Under *Standish*, non-matrimonial assets can only be invaded for demonstrated needs; she hasn't shown any |
| **Medium** | Charlotte's savings account | £785 total payments; undisclosed child asset |
| **High** | Universal Credit statements | Documents her income; any inconsistencies will be self-evident |
| **Medium** | Undisclosed income streams | Affects income assessment |
| **Low** | Child Benefit omission | Small sums; disclosure point only |
| **Omit** | Sleeping arrangements, previous occupants | Risk of appearing vexatious |

## Explanatory Notes (Not for Submission)

### New Questions Added Following Form E Review

| New Question | Basis | Why Material |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| 1.1 (Section 1.8 vs 4.6) | Form E shows "No" to living with partner at 1.8, but Section 4.6 completed | Internal contradiction goes to credibility |
| 1.2 (Missing housing costs) | Section 3.1.1 needs schedule omits rent, utilities, food | Either costs met by third party or incomplete disclosure |

### Questions Updated Following Bank Statement Forensic Analysis

| Question | Update | Basis |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 3.3 (Payments to Gray) | Expanded from £1,000 to £1,535 | Bank statements show three "Citizenship" payments: £500 (22 Apr), £35 (23 Apr), £1,000 (6 Jun) |
| 5.1 (Payments from Gray) | Added references and 5 Sep payment | References show "Shopping", "Personal Expenses", "Loan", "Cashpal" |
| 3.4 (Charlotte savings) | **NEW** | £785 total to "Ms C G Kaye" (14 × £25 "Savings" + £435 "Child Benefit") - undisclosed child asset |
| 6.2 (Food charge) | **NEW - HIGH** | £200/month "Food" charge appears from April 2025 (first payment April 1); if food was previously included in £500 rent, why separate charge starting when employment began? |
| 6.3 (Asymmetrical payments) | **NEW - CRITICAL** | Comprehensive analysis reveals £4,902.77 out vs £1,780.62 in = £3,122.15 net outflow (excluding legitimate rent/food); suggests undisclosed assets held by Joy OR undisclosed debt to Joy OR unexplained cash movements |

### Questions Omitted and Reasons

| Original Question | Reason for Omission |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Sleeping arrangements at 12A | Intrusive; unlikely to be ordered; risks appearing vexatious |
| Previous occupants of 12A (Megyn Thorne) | Tangential; investigative rather than disclosure-focused |
| Explanation for late disclosure of Oct/Nov statements | Backward-looking; statements now provided |
| Full details of relationship with Mr Thorne's family | Speculative; better addressed through documents requested |
| Philippines payments (~£450 total) | Categorised as "PH" - likely family remittances; not material to outcome |
| Declaration to DWP re non-dependent adults | UC statements will show declared household composition |
| Pointed questions about UC housing element vs rent | Risk of appearing accusatory; documents will show it |
| Nature of relationship with Mr Thorne | Asked neutrally at 1.1; her answer to Form E contradiction will reveal this |
| "Food" payments from April 2025 | £200/month labeled "Food" from Apr 2025 is noted but hard to frame as question without speculation; may have innocent explanation |
| Lucy Timog payments (net £2,238) | Payments to/from sister appear to be informal family arrangements; not material |

### Strategic Notes

1. **Lead with the Form E contradictions**: Questions 1.1 and 1.2 are now first because they arise directly from her own sworn disclosure. You're not making accusations - you're asking her to explain inconsistencies in her own document. This is hard to criticise.

2. **The missing housing costs point is very strong**: It's factual and non-accusatory. Everyone has rent/utilities/food costs. Either she pays them (and should have disclosed them) or she doesn't (and someone else is subsidising her). The question lets her explain without pre-judging.

3. **Focus on documents, not explanations**: The tenancy agreement, UC statements, and utility bills will answer most questions without requiring admissions. Let the documents do the work.

4. **Tone**: The questions are neutral and reference specific Form E sections. This demonstrates you've reviewed her disclosure carefully and are seeking clarification of genuine gaps, not conducting harassment.

5. **The cohabitation issue**: Note that Question 1.1 does not directly ask "Are you in a relationship with Mr Thorne?" Instead, it asks her to explain her own contradictory answers. This is more effective - she must either:
   - Admit 1.8 was wrong (she is living with a partner), or
   - Explain why she completed 4.6 if she's not

   Either answer advances your position.

6. **The food charge question (6.2) exposes a change in circumstances**: The £200/month food charge appearing in April 2025 is significant because:
   - It coincides with her starting employment at PsychUK (first salary 25 April 2025)
   - It suggests the rental arrangement changed once she had income
   - If food was previously included in rent, why was it suddenly charged separately?
   - This goes to credibility and whether her needs are genuinely as low as Form E suggests

7. **The asymmetrical payments question (6.3) is the most powerful disclosure tool**: Even after excluding legitimate rent and food costs, the net outflow of £3,122.15 to Joy demands explanation. This is not a normal financial pattern. She must explain:
   - If Joy is holding assets for her → undisclosed assets in Form E
   - If she owes Joy money → undisclosed liability in Form E
   - If neither → what did she receive for £3,122 net outflow?

   **She cannot answer this question without either:**
   (a) Admitting Form E is materially incomplete, OR
   (b) Providing documentation that will reveal her true financial position

   The "Citizenship" payments (£1,535 out, £200 back = £1,335 unaccounted) are particularly suspicious. The "Cashpal" pattern (£500 out in installments, £400 back as lump sum) suggests cash banking.

### Bank Statement Analysis Summary

**Joylyn Gray Payments (by reference):**

| Reference | Total Out | Total In | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| House | £7,000 | - | 14 × £500 monthly rent |
| Food | £1,600 | £17 | £200/month from April 2025 |
| Citizenship | £1,535 | - | Three payments; only £200 returned as "Loan" |
| Cashpal | £500 | £400 | Monthly cash arrangement |
| Lucy / Lucy Payment | £490 | - | Routed through Joy for Lucy (sister) |
| Shopping | - | £807 | Reimbursements |
| PH (Philippines) | £450+ | - | Family remittances |
| Other misc | Various | Various | Nails, tulips, town, etc. |

**Key observations:**
- "House" = rent at £500/month (confirmed 14 months) - **legitimate expense known to Mark**
- "Food" = separate £200/month from April 2025 - **NEW charge coinciding with employment start**; if food was previously included in rent, this represents either:
  (a) A change in rental terms when Lenny gained income, or
  (b) Evidence that food was never actually included
- "Citizenship" = £1,535 total, only £200 returned = **£1,335 unaccounted**
- "Cashpal" = £500 out, £400 back = pattern suggests cash banking arrangement
- **Total net outflow excluding rent/food: £3,122.15** - no legitimate explanation visible in bank statements
- Some payments labeled to Joy were actually for Lucy (e.g., £90 "Lucy Payment")
