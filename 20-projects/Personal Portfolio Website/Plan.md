## Project Plan: Personal Portfolio Website

**Goal:** To create a personal portfolio/CV website showcasing skills in DevOps, SRE, Monitoring, and IaC.
### Proposed Plan:

1.  **Define Content & Structure:**
    *   Outline sections: About Me, Experience, Projects (with focus on DevOps/SRE/IaC), Skills, Contact.
    *   Gather content for each section (text, links to repos, live demos).
    *   Choose a static site generator (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll, Next.js for static export) or a simple HTML/CSS/JS setup.

2.  **Development Environment Setup:**
    *   Initialize a Git repository.
    *   Set up local development environment (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go, depending on chosen tech stack).

3.  **Website Development (Frontend):**
    *   Design and implement the website layout and styling.
    *   Populate content for each section.
    *   Ensure responsiveness for various devices.

4.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    *   Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
    *   Use Terraform or Pulumi to define and provision the necessary infrastructure (e.g., S3 bucket for static hosting, CloudFront/CDN for distribution, DNS records).

5.  **DevOps & CI/CD:**
    *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
    *   Automate building, testing, and deploying the website to the cloud infrastructure.
    *   Implement linting, security checks, and accessibility checks in the pipeline.

6.  **Monitoring & Observability:**
    *   Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, CloudWatch, Stackdriver) to track website performance, availability, and user traffic.
    *   Set up alerts for critical issues.
    *   Implement logging for website access and errors.

7.  **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Principles:**
    *   Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for the website.
    *   Implement error budgets.
    *   Focus on automation, reliability, and scalability throughout the development and deployment process.

8.  **Testing:**
    *   Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the website.
    *   Automate testing within the CI/CD pipeline.

9.  **Security:**
    *   Implement best practices for website security (e.g., HTTPS, content security policies).
    *   Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.

10. **Documentation:**
    *   Document the project setup, deployment process, and monitoring configurations.
