# Monitoring & Observability

## Goal
To implement tools and practices that provide deep insights into the website's performance, availability, and user interactions in real-time. This enables proactive identification and resolution of issues, ensuring a high-quality user experience.

## Detailed Design Steps

### 6.1. Choose Monitoring Tools
*   **Action:** Select appropriate tools for collecting metrics, logs, and traces.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Cloud-native:** AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver), Azure Monitor.
    *   **Open Source:** Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (dashboards), Loki (logs), Jaeger/Zipkin (tracing).
    *   **SaaS Solutions:** Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace.

### 6.2. Metrics Collection
*   **Action:** Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and collect relevant metrics from the website and its infrastructure.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Website Metrics:** Page load time, request latency, error rates (HTTP 5xx), traffic volume, unique visitors.
    *   **Infrastructure Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network throughput for hosting resources (e.g., S3, CloudFront, EC2).
    *   **Application-specific Metrics:** If there's a backend, database query times, API response times.

### 6.3. Logging Strategy
*   **Action:** Implement centralized logging for application and infrastructure events.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Log Aggregation:** Send logs from various sources to a central logging system (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, GCP Cloud Logging, ELK Stack).
    *   **Log Format:** Standardize log formats for easier parsing and analysis.
    *   **Contextual Logging:** Include relevant context (e.g., request ID, user ID) in logs.

### 6.4. Alerting Configuration
*   **Action:** Set up alerts for critical issues that require immediate attention.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Thresholds:** Define appropriate thresholds for metrics (e.g., 5xx error rate > 1%, CPU utilization > 80%).
    *   **Notification Channels:** Configure alerts to be sent to relevant channels (e.g., Slack, email, PagerDuty).
    *   **Severity Levels:** Assign severity levels to alerts to prioritize responses.

### 6.5. Dashboard Creation
*   **Action:** Create dashboards to visualize key metrics and application health in real-time.
*   **Consideration:**
    *   **Overview Dashboard:** A high-level view of the entire system's health.
    *   **Detailed Dashboards:** Specific dashboards for frontend performance, infrastructure health, or application-specific metrics.
    *   **Accessibility:** Ensure dashboards are easy to understand and interpret.

### 6.6. Tracing (Optional but Recommended)
*   **Action:** Implement distributed tracing to understand the flow of requests through different services.
*   **Consideration:** Useful if the portfolio evolves into a more complex microservices architecture.

### 6.7. Synthetic Monitoring
*   **Action:** Set up automated checks to simulate user interactions and monitor website availability and performance from various locations.
*   **Consideration:** Tools like UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or cloud-native synthetic monitoring services.
