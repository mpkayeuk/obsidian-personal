**Tadej Pogačar** (born 21 September 1998) is a Slovenian professional road racing cyclist who rides for UCI WorldTeam UAE Team Emirates. He is widely regarded as one of the most dominant and versatile cyclists of his generation, with some considering him to be among the greatest of all time.

Pogačar's list of achievements is extensive and remarkable. He is a four-time winner of the Tour de France (2020, 2021, 2024, and 2025), and also won the Giro d'Italia in 2024. In 2024, he achieved the "Triple Crown of Cycling" by winning the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and the UCI Road World Championships in the same year, a feat only accomplished by a select few in the history of the sport.

He has also shown his prowess in one-day races, with multiple victories in Monuments such as the Tour of Flanders, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and Il Lombardia. His aggressive racing style and all-around abilities make him a formidable contender in any race he enters.
