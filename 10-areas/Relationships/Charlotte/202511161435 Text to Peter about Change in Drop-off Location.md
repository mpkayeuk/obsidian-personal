# Gemini Note

## Prompt

Lenny told me that Charlotte and her have moved to a flat in Cromer... I need to send a gentle text to my neighbours (who are my supervisors) to let them know that when we take Charlotte home after a visit, it will have to be to Cromer now instead of North Walsham.  Here is what I have as a starter, but please help me finish this message: Hi Peter, just a quick note to let you know that Lenny told me today that they had moved to a flat in Cromer.

## Response Summary

I helped draft a gentle and clear text message to inform the user's neighbour/supervisor about the change in their daughter's drop-off location.

My suggested text was: "Hi Peter, just a quick note to let you know that Lenny told me today that they have moved to a flat in Cromer. This means for future visits, we'll be dropping Charlotte off there instead of North Walsham. Just wanted to keep you in the loop. All the best."

The actual message sent by the user was: "Hi Peter, just a quick note to let you know that Lenny told me today that they have moved to a flat in Cromer. This means for future visits, we'll be dropping Charlotte off there instead of North Walsham. Just wanted to keep you in the loop and ask if that’s okay. Thank you."
