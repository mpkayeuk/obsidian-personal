# Application for Permission to Serve Extended Questionnaire

**Case Number:** 1756206544908210
**Court:** Norwich Combined Court
**Applicant:** Lenny Timog Kaye
**Respondent:** Mark Peter Kaye

---

## Application

The Respondent applies pursuant to Practice Direction 27A for permission to serve a questionnaire on the Applicant's Form E that exceeds the usual 4-page limit.

The questionnaire is 8 pages in length (12pt font, 1.5 line spacing).

---

## Grounds

The Respondent submits that the extended length is necessary and proportionate for the following reasons:

### 1. Material Internal Contradictions in Form E

The Applicant's Form E contains contradictory statements that require clarification:

- Question 1.8: The Applicant answered "No" to living with a new partner
- Section 4.6: The Applicant has completed the new partner disclosure section, naming Mr Terry Thorne as an occupant with income of £27,000 per annum

This contradiction goes to the credibility of the Applicant's disclosure and affects the assessment of household resources available to meet her needs.

### 2. Potentially Significant Undisclosed Assets

Bank statements disclosed by the Applicant reveal transactions suggesting undisclosed assets that require investigation:

**a) Property in the Philippines**
- Bank statements show payments totalling £3,524.79 to the Philippines over 15 months (August 2024 - October 2025)
- Payments made via Remitly (£876.79), Ms Lucy Timog (£2,308.00), and Ms Joylyn Gray (£571.00)
- Section 2.10 of Form E (property outside England and Wales) shows nil disclosure
- This could represent a material undisclosed asset

**b) Employee Share Scheme**
- Bank statements show receipt of £1,912.47 from "M+G Trustee Comp" on 4 June 2025
- This payment is not disclosed anywhere in Form E
- The name "M+G Trustee Comp" suggests a share trustee holding shares on behalf of employees
- Section 2.4 (Investments) and Section 2.15 (Other Assets) show nil disclosure
- This could represent undisclosed shares, stock options, or share scheme participation

**c) Unexplained Financial Flows**
- Bank statements show payments to Ms Joylyn Gray totalling £12,682.77 with only £1,780.62 received back
- Net outflow: £10,902.15
- Excluding acknowledged rent (£7,000) and food (£1,600), the net outflow is £3,122.15
- This includes £1,535 in payments referenced "Citizenship" with only £200 returned as "Loan"
- Section 2.6 (Money owed to you) shows nil disclosure
- These transactions suggest either undisclosed assets held by third parties, undisclosed liabilities, or unexplained cash movements

### 3. Incomplete Needs Disclosure

The Applicant's income needs schedule (Section 3.1.1) declares needs of £650 per month comprising:
- Mobile phone
- Holidays/outings
- Petrol
- Car insurance

**No provision is made for:**
- Rent or mortgage
- Council tax
- Gas, electricity, water
- Food and groceries
- Internet or broadband
- Clothing
- Household goods

This omission is material in the context of the *Standish v Standish* [2024] EWCA Civ 567 principle that non-matrimonial assets may only be invaded to meet **demonstrated needs**.

The Respondent's position is that the majority of his pension assets (£129,408 out of £161,390) are non-matrimonial. The Applicant bears the burden of demonstrating needs that would justify invasion of those assets. Her Form E does not discharge that burden.

The questionnaire seeks to clarify whether the Applicant pays for essential living costs (and if not, who does), which is directly relevant to the needs assessment under *Standish*.

### 4. Household Income and Resources

Section 4.6 discloses that Mr Terry Thorne resides at the Applicant's address with income of £27,000 per annum (the same figure as the Applicant's declared salary).

If accurate, the combined household income is approximately £54,000 per annum (excluding Universal Credit and child maintenance), yet the declared needs are only £650 per month with no housing costs.

Clarification of Mr Thorne's contributions to household expenses is necessary to understand the Applicant's true financial position and resource availability.

### 5. Other Material Omissions

The questionnaire also addresses:
- Omission of Child Benefit from income (approximately £113 per week = £1,456 per annum)
- Credit card disclosed as liability (£1,633.94) when bank statements suggest it is paid in full monthly (£850-£1,236/month payments), potentially overstating liabilities by 42%
- Payments to Charlotte's savings account (£785 total) not disclosed as child asset

### 6. Standard Disclosure Documents Outstanding

The questionnaire requests standard disclosure documents including:
- Universal Credit award statements (to verify household composition and entitlement)
- Tenancy agreement (to verify housing arrangements and named tenants)
- Utility bills and council tax (to verify who pays household costs)
- Documentation regarding undisclosed receipts and assets

---

## Proportionality

The Respondent submits that the extended questionnaire is proportionate because:

1. The Respondent is a litigant in person and has attempted to limit questions to material issues only

2. The issues raised go to fundamental questions of disclosure completeness and needs assessment that must be resolved before meaningful settlement negotiations can occur

3. The alternative would be incomplete disclosure proceeding to FDR, resulting in:
   - Settlement proposals based on inaccurate information
   - Unreliable judicial indication
   - Potential need for further directions and additional hearings
   - Increased costs and delay

4. Early clarification of these issues will assist the court and the parties in reaching a fair resolution efficiently

5. The questionnaire does not raise vexatious or oppressive questions - each question relates directly to gaps or inconsistencies in the Applicant's Form E or to transactions visible in disclosed bank statements

---

## Order Sought

The Respondent respectfully invites the court to grant permission to serve the 8-page questionnaire on the Applicant.

In the alternative, if the court considers the questionnaire should be reduced, the Respondent invites the court to indicate which categories of questions should be prioritised or excluded.
