# ECO4 Funding Scheme Summary

## What is ECO4?

The ECO4 funding scheme is the UK government's main program to fight fuel poverty, lower carbon emissions, and make homes more energy-efficient. It started in July 2022 and will run until March 2026, with a budget of about £4 billion. The goal is to help low-income and vulnerable families by paying for energy-saving home upgrades.

## Eligibility

You might be eligible for ECO4 if:

*   You own or rent your home.
*   Your home has an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of D, E, F, or G.
*   Someone in your household gets one of these benefits:
    *   Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)
    *   Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
    *   Income Support (IS)
    *   Pension Credit (Guarantee/Savings)
    *   Working Tax Credit (WTC)
    *   Child Tax Credit (CTC)
    *   Universal Credit (UC)
    *   Housing Benefit
    *   Child Benefit (with an income cap)
*   Your household income is less than £31,000.
*   You or someone in your home has a health condition that gets worse in the cold.
*   **ECO4 Flex:** Even if you don't get benefits, you might still qualify through the Local Authority Flexible Eligibility (LA Flex) program.

## How to Apply

1.  **Check Eligibility:** Make sure you meet the criteria.
2.  **Contact an Installer:** The scheme is managed by accredited installers who handle the funding. You can apply through your energy supplier, local council, or a specialized assessor.
3.  **Assessment:** An assessor will check your home to see what improvements are needed.
4.  **Installation:** The installer will do the work. The funding is claimed directly from energy suppliers, so it costs you little to nothing.

*   Boiler upgrades or replacements

*   Air source heat pumps
*   Solar panels
