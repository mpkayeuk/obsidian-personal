## Re: Financial Remedy Proceedings - Case No. 1756206544908210

Dear Ms Kaye,

### Service of Questionnaire on Form E

I write further to your Form E dated 23 December 2025.

I enclose my questionnaire on your Form E, served pursuant to **Rule 9.14 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010**.

The questionnaire seeks clarification of matters arising from your Form E and requests production of documents necessary for full and frank disclosure in accordance with your obligations under FPR 9.14 and the principles established in case law.

### Response Required

**Deadline for Response:** [INSERT DATE - typically 21 days from service]

Please note that under FPR 9.14(3), you must respond to this questionnaire by the date specified above unless the court orders otherwise.

Your response should:

1. Answer each question in the order asked
2. Be signed and verified by a statement of truth
3. Be accompanied by all documents requested in the questionnaire

### Documents Requested

For ease of reference, the documents requested in the questionnaire are:

**1. Housing and Living Costs**
- Tenancy agreement for 12A Newhaven Court, Cromer
- Utility bills (gas, electricity, water) for current address showing named account holders
- Council tax demand or statement for current address showing named liable person(s)
- Internet/broadband bills showing named account holder

**2. Universal Credit**
- Award notices or statements from the Department for Work and Pensions covering the period September 2025 to date
- Current award notice showing household composition declared to DWP

**3. Bank Accounts**
- Current statements (last 3 months) for any bank account held jointly with Mr Terry Thorne or any other person
- Current statement for any savings account held for Charlotte Grace Kaye (showing all transactions for the year)

**4. Undisclosed Receipts**
- Documentation explaining the payment of £1,912.47 received from "M+G Trustee Comp" on 4 June 2025
- Any correspondence or statements relating to this payment

**5. Philippines Property**
- If you have purchased property in the Philippines:
  - Copy of title deed or land certificate
  - Valuation or evidence of current market value
  - Documentation showing purchase price and source of funds
  - Any mortgage or loan documentation
- If the payments to Philippines were family remittances only:
  - Bank statements or transfer receipts showing recipients
  - Explanation of the nature and frequency of these remittances

**6. Mr Terry Thorne's Income**
- Verification of Mr Thorne's income declared at Section 4.6 of your Form E (£27,000 per annum):
  - Recent payslips (last 3 months), or
  - P60 for tax year 2024/25, or
  - SA302 and tax year overview if self-employed

**7. Child Benefit**
- Award letter or statement showing current Child Benefit entitlement for Charlotte

**8. Joylyn Gray Transactions**
- Documentation explaining:
  - "Citizenship" payments totalling £1,535
  - "Cashpal" transactions (£500 paid out, £400 received back)
  - Any loan agreement with Ms Gray
  - Receipts or invoices for any goods or services received from Ms Gray

### Duty of Full and Frank Disclosure

I remind you of your continuing duty to provide full and frank disclosure of all matters relevant to these financial remedy proceedings. This duty is a fundamental principle of family finance litigation and applies to both parties equally.

If any matter disclosed in your Form E has changed since 23 December 2025, or if you become aware of any error or omission in your Form E, you must inform me and the court immediately.

### First Appointment

I note your request that the First Appointment be converted to a Financial Dispute Resolution appointment pursuant to FPR 9.15.

I have filed a separate objection to that application on the grounds that disclosure remains incomplete. The court will determine that application at the First Appointment.

In my respectful submission, conversion to FDR would be premature while significant gaps in disclosure remain. The proper course is to complete disclosure first, then list an FDR when both parties can negotiate on the basis of full and accurate information.

### Service

I am serving this questionnaire and covering letter:
- By post to your address at 12A Newhaven Court, Cromer
- [DELETE IF NOT APPLICABLE: By email to [INSERT EMAIL]]

A copy has been filed with the court.

### Further Correspondence

Please ensure that all responses and documents are sent to me at the above address [and by email to [INSERT EMAIL IF YOU HAVE ONE]] by the deadline specified above.

If you require an extension of time to respond, please contact me as soon as possible with reasons. I will consider any reasonable request for a short extension, but please note that any significant delay may affect the court's ability to give directions at the First Appointment.

### Timeline:

Typical timeline:
- **Day 0:** You serve questionnaire
- **Day 21:** Lenny's answers due
- **Week 4:** If no response, chase in writing
- **Week 5:** Consider applying to court for directions if still no response

### Tone Notes:

The letter is:
- ✅ Formal and professional
- ✅ Non-accusatory in tone
- ✅ Clear about obligations and deadlines
- ✅ Firm but not aggressive
- ✅ Reminds of disclosure duties without being preachy
- ✅ Acknowledges her FDR request but maintains your objection

This tone is important because:
1. The court will see this correspondence
2. You want to appear reasonable and cooperative
3. You're seeking information, not making accusations (yet)
4. If she fails to respond, your professional approach strengthens any application for orders

### What Happens Next:

**If she responds properly:**
- Review answers carefully
- Check if documents are complete
- Decide if further questions needed
- Consider settlement discussions

**If she responds incompletely:**
- Write to identify gaps
- Request missing items
- Apply to court for orders if necessary

**If she doesn't respond at all:**
- Chase in writing after deadline
- Apply to court for:
  - Order compelling answers
  - Unless order (answer by X date or claim struck out)
  - Costs of the application

### Cost Note:

Keep detailed records of:
- Time spent preparing questionnaire
- Postage costs
- Any other disbursements

If Lenny fails to respond properly and you have to apply to court, you may be able to recover these costs.
