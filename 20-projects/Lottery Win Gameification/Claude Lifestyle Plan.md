# Lifestyle Plan

## Executive Summary

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Generational Wealth Core (FIC) | £182,000,000 | Long-term preservation + Lombard collateral |
| Immediate Lifestyle Setup | £28,000,000 | Gifts, philanthropy, initial purchases |
| **Total** | **£210,000,000** | |

**Core Strategy: "Buy, Borrow, Die"**
- Maximise assets in FIC
- Borrow against portfolio via Lombard loans for spending
- Avoid taxable events (dividends, capital gains)
- Debt reduces estate; assets pass to heirs

---

## Part 1: Generational Wealth Core (£182M)

### Structure: Family Investment Company (FIC)

A Family Investment Company provides significant tax advantages:
- Corporation tax at 19-25% vs personal income tax at 45%
- Dividend control (take income only when needed)
- IHT planning through share structure
- Asset protection
- **Lombard loan collateral** - borrow against portfolio tax-free

#### FIC Share Structure

| Share Class | Holder | Rights |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| A Shares (Voting) | You | Full control, minimal value |
| B Shares (Growth) | Children/Trusts | Capital growth, no voting |
| C Shares (Income) | Discretionary | Dividend rights as needed |

#### FIC Investment Allocation (£182M)

| Asset Class | Allocation | Amount | Expected Return | Annual Growth |
|-------------|------------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Global Equity Index Funds | 40% | £72,800,000 | 7% | £5,096,000 |
| UK/Global Bond Funds | 20% | £36,400,000 | 4% | £1,456,000 |
| Commercial Property | 15% | £27,300,000 | 5% | £1,365,000 |
| Private Equity/VC | 10% | £18,200,000 | 12% | £2,184,000 |
| Infrastructure Funds | 10% | £18,200,000 | 6% | £1,092,000 |
| Cash/Gilts Buffer | 5% | £9,100,000 | 4% | £364,000 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **£182,000,000** | **6.4%** | **£11,648,000** |

**Note:** Returns retained in FIC. No dividends drawn. Spending funded via Lombard loans.

#### IHT Planning within FIC

- **Business Property Relief (BPR):** Invest portion in BPR-qualifying assets (unlisted shares, AIM stocks, trading businesses) - 100% IHT relief after 2 years
- **Freezer Shares:** Your voting shares frozen in value; growth accrues to children's shares
- **Lombard Debt:** Outstanding loans reduce taxable estate value
- **Life Insurance:** Whole-of-life policy in trust to cover any residual IHT liability

---

## Part 2: Lombard Loan Strategy

### What is a Lombard Loan?

A securities-backed credit facility where you borrow against your investment portfolio:
- **No sale of assets** = No CGT triggered
- **Loan proceeds are not income** = No income tax
- **Assets continue compounding** = Wealth grows while you spend
- **Interest potentially deductible** = If used for investment purposes
- **Debt reduces estate** = IHT benefit

### Lombard Facility Structure

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Collateral** | FIC portfolio (£182M) |
| **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** | 50% conservative limit |
| **Available Credit** | £91,000,000 |
| **Interest Rate** | SONIA + 1.5% (~6.5% current) |
| **Facility Type** | Revolving credit line |
| **Provider** | Private bank (Coutts, HSBC Private, Lombard Odier) |

### Tax Comparison: Lombard vs Dividends

For £500,000 annual spending:

| Method | Amount Needed | Tax/Cost | Effective Rate |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **Dividend from FIC** | £825,000 gross | £325,000 tax | 39.4% |
| **Lombard Loan** | £500,000 borrowed | £32,500 interest | 6.5% |
| **Annual Saving** | | **£292,500** | |

Over 20 years at £500K/year spending: **£5.85M saved**

### Lombard Usage Strategy

#### Tier 1: Major Purchases (Draw and Hold)
| Purchase | Amount | Repayment Strategy |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Main residence | £12,000,000 | Never repay - offset by asset growth |
| Holiday homes | £10,000,000 | Never repay - offset by asset growth |
| City apartment | £3,000,000 | Never repay - offset by asset growth |
| Vehicles & toys | £3,000,000 | 5-year amortisation from facility |
| **Subtotal** | **£28,000,000** | |

#### Tier 2: Annual Lifestyle (Revolving)
| Category | Annual Draw | Interest Cost |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Lifestyle spending | £400,000 | £26,000 |
| Property running costs | £120,000 | £7,800 |
| Travel & experiences | £100,000 | £6,500 |
| **Subtotal** | **£620,000** | **£40,300** |

#### Tier 3: Opportunistic (As Needed)
- Art and collectibles purchases
- Business/investment opportunities
- Large family gifts (repay via PET strategy)
- Emergency/unexpected needs

### Lombard Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Margin call** (portfolio drops) | Maintain <50% LTV; £9M cash buffer in FIC |
| **Interest rate rise** | Fix portion of debt; rates above 10% trigger dividend fallback |
| **Compounding debt** | Annual review; strategic repayment from low-tax sources |
| **Over-leverage** | Hard cap at 60% LTV regardless of circumstances |

### Loan Balance Projection

| Year | Opening Debt | New Draws | Interest | Growth Offset | Closing Debt | LTV |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------|---------------|--------------|-----|
| 1 | £0 | £28,620,000 | £1,860,000 | -£11,648,000 | £30,480,000 | 15% |
| 5 | £30,480,000 | £3,100,000 | £2,183,000 | -£14,200,000 | £35,763,000 | 16% |
| 10 | £35,763,000 | £3,100,000 | £2,527,000 | -£17,800,000 | £41,590,000 | 15% |
| 20 | £41,590,000 | £3,100,000 | £2,905,000 | -£28,100,000 | £47,595,000 | 12% |

**Result:** LTV actually *decreases* over time as portfolio growth outpaces borrowing. Debt becomes proportionally smaller.
