## PART 2: STATEMENT OF ISSUES

### 1. Non-Disclosure of Assets
The Applicant has failed to disclose:
*   **Property Abroad:** Remittances of >£3,500 to the Philippines, consistent with her stated intention to buy land.
*   **Investments:** A £1,912 payment from "M+G Trustee" and an admitted employee share scheme.
*   **Cash Assets:** A net outflow of ~£3,000 to Ms. Joylyn Gray, suggesting hidden cash reserves.

### 2. Cohabitation & Household Economy
The Applicant cohabits with Mr. Thorne (earning £27k p.a.). The Applicant discloses she is living with a partner but denies cohabitation at Question 1.8. This inconsistency must be resolved to determine the true economic reality of her household.

### 3. Matrimonial vs. Non-Matrimonial Pension (*Standish*)
The Respondent's PensionBee (£100k) and Standard Life (£28k) pensions are **pre-marital** assets with no marital contributions. Under *Standish v Standish*, these are non-matrimonial assets and are excluded from the sharing principle.

### 4. The Deficit in the Marital Pot
The only marital asset is the NEST pension (£31k). This is dwarfed by the marital debt of **£69,033** borne solely by the Respondent. The net marital pot is **negative (-£37k)**. There is no surplus to share.

### 5. Disparity in Earning Capacity
The Respondent (51) has **zero** earning capacity until age 59 due to SHPO restrictions and cannot rebuild his pension. The Applicant (35) has full earning capacity, no debt, and 32 years to build her own pension. A pension share would leave the Respondent destitute in retirement while the Applicant thrives.

---
**Respondent's Position:**
The case warrants a **Clean Break** with no Pension Sharing Order, as the Respondent holds no shareable matrimonial assets.
