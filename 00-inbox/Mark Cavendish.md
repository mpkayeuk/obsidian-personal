**Mark Simon Cavendish** CH, MBE (born 21 May 1985) is a recently retired Manx professional road and track racing cyclist, who last rode for UCI WorldTeam Astana Qazaqstan Team. As a road sprinter, he is not just one of, but arguably *the* greatest of all time, a title he has proven time and again with his unparalleled record of victories.

Cavendish's palmarès is nothing short of legendary. He holds the outright record for stage wins at the Tour de France with a remarkable 35 victories, a feat that places him at the pinnacle of the sport's history. His dominance is further highlighted by winning the Tour's points classification in 2011 and 2021. Beyond the Tour, he has claimed 17 stage wins at the Giro d'Italia and three at the Vuelta a España, bringing his Grand Tour stage win total to an astounding 55. His career also includes a prestigious victory at the Milan-San Remo classic in 2009.

In 2011, he achieved a career-defining victory, becoming the UCI Road Race World Champion in Copenhagen. His versatility is also demonstrated by his success on the track, where he has won three world championship titles in the madison, including an early victory with partner Bradley Wiggins.

Cavendish's career has been a dramatic narrative of highs and lows. After a challenging period from 2018, where he struggled with form, illness, and mental health, he engineered one of the most spectacular comebacks in sporting history in 2021, returning to the pinnacle of sprinting. Initially announcing his retirement at the end of the 2023 season, his insatiable drive for greatness saw him return for the 2024 season with the singular goal of breaking the all-time Tour de France stage win record, which he gloriously achieved. He officially retired from professional cycling in November 2024.
