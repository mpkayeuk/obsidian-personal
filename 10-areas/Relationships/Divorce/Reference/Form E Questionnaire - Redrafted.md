# Form E Questionnaire
## Prioritised Questions for the Applicant

---

### Materiality Analysis

| Priority | Issue | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Critical** | Form E internal contradictions (1.8 vs 4.6) | Goes to credibility; she denies living with partner but completes partner disclosure section |
| **Critical** | Missing housing costs in needs schedule | Her needs omit rent, utilities, food - suggests costs being met by third party |
| **Critical** | Undisclosed assets (M&G, loan to Gray) | Affects capital position |
| **High** | PensionBee "in drawdown" at age 35 | Unusual; may explain M&G payment; needs clarification |
| **High** | Universal Credit statements | Documents her income; any inconsistencies will be self-evident |
| **Medium** | Undisclosed income streams | Affects income assessment |
| **Low** | Child Benefit omission | Small sums; disclosure point only |
| **Omit** | Sleeping arrangements, previous occupants | Risk of appearing vexatious |

## PART A: QUESTIONS (Priority Order)

### 1. Form E Clarifications

However, you have completed Section 4.6, which is headed: *"If you have subsequently married or formed a civil partnership (or intend to) or are living with another person (or intend to), give brief details..."*

## Explanatory Notes (Not for Submission)

### New Questions Added Following Form E Review

| New Question | Basis | Why Material |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| 1.1 (Section 1.8 vs 4.6) | Form E shows "No" to living with partner at 1.8, but Section 4.6 completed | Internal contradiction goes to credibility |
| 1.2 (Missing housing costs) | Section 3.1.1 needs schedule omits rent, utilities, food | Either costs met by third party or incomplete disclosure |
| 3.1 (Pension drawdown) | PensionBee marked "in drawdown" at age 35 | Highly unusual; may explain M&G payment |

### Questions Omitted and Reasons

| Original Question | Reason for Omission |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Sleeping arrangements at 12A | Intrusive; unlikely to be ordered; risks appearing vexatious |
| Previous occupants of 12A (Megyn Thorne) | Tangential; investigative rather than disclosure-focused |
| Explanation for late disclosure of Oct/Nov statements | Backward-looking; statements now provided |
| Full details of relationship with Mr Thorne's family | Speculative; better addressed through documents requested |
| Philippines payments (~£270 total) | *De minimis*; unlikely to be material to outcome |
| Declaration to DWP re non-dependent adults | UC statements will show declared household composition |
| Pointed questions about UC housing element vs rent | Risk of appearing accusatory; documents will show it |
| Nature of relationship with Mr Thorne | Asked neutrally at 1.1; her answer to Form E contradiction will reveal this |

### Strategic Notes

1. **Lead with the Form E contradictions**: Questions 1.1 and 1.2 are now first because they arise directly from her own sworn disclosure. You're not making accusations - you're asking her to explain inconsistencies in her own document. This is hard to criticise.

2. **The missing housing costs point is very strong**: It's factual and non-accusatory. Everyone has rent/utilities/food costs. Either she pays them (and should have disclosed them) or she doesn't (and someone else is subsidising her). The question lets her explain without pre-judging.

3. **The pension drawdown question**: This is unusual enough to warrant inquiry. If it's a form-filling error, she can say so. If she genuinely accessed pension funds early, the court needs to know how and why - and whether the M&G payment relates to it.

4. **Focus on documents, not explanations**: The tenancy agreement, UC statements, and utility bills will answer most questions without requiring admissions. Let the documents do the work.

5. **Tone**: The questions are neutral and reference specific Form E sections. This demonstrates you've reviewed her disclosure carefully and are seeking clarification of genuine gaps, not conducting harassment.

6. **The cohabitation issue**: Note that Question 1.1 does not directly ask "Are you in a relationship with Mr Thorne?" Instead, it asks her to explain her own contradictory answers. This is more effective - she must either:
   - Admit 1.8 was wrong (she is living with a partner), or
   - Explain why she completed 4.6 if she's not

   Either answer advances your position.
