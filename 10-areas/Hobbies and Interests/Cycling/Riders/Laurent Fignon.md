**Laurent Fignon** (August 12, 1960 – August 31, 2010) was a French professional road bicycle racer, instantly recognizable by his distinctive glasses and often referred to as "Le Professeur" due to his intellectual approach to racing. He was a dominant figure in the 1980s, known for his aggressive style and powerful time trialing.

Fignon's career highlights include winning the Tour de France in consecutive years, 1983 and 1984. At just 22 years old in 1983, he became one of the youngest winners of the Tour, signaling the arrival of a new force in professional cycling. He also triumphed in the Giro d'Italia in 1989, showcasing his Grand Tour capabilities.

However, Fignon is perhaps most famously remembered for the agonizingly narrow loss in the 1989 Tour de France, where he was beaten by Greg LeMond by a mere eight seconds on the final day's individual time trial – the closest margin in the event's history. This dramatic finish remains one of the most iconic moments in cycling.

After retiring from cycling in 1993, Fignon remained involved in the sport as a race organizer and television commentator. He tragically passed away from cancer in 2010 at the age of 50, leaving behind a legacy as a brilliant, complex, and unforgettable champion.
